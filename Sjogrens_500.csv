I write from Galicia, in the northwest of Spain. I join this forum to share wih all of you about our experiences and the most important (for me), to find and feel some emocional support.

I am a 40 years woman who was diagnosted of this illness in 2008 and I have had to pass alone without any support of my parents or ""friends"" this situation, and other ciscusntances that everybody could live.

I do not want to make you feel pity to me. Only I try to express my life experience.

Right now I suffer pain in my muscles and some articulations, dry eyes and I am voiceless as consequence ofÃ¥Ã_ the few and bad quality of my saliva.

I appreciate you time and apologize me for my grammar mistakes.

Cheers!",4,5,237434935,5896,"Hello and Welcome Lou.


I am sorry to hear you've had sjogrens with little or no support.

Do you work? If so, what do you do at your job?

Are you on any medications for your sjogrens?


Many of us here have more than one autoimmune disease?

Also, we all take different kinds of treatments/medications for our

sjogrens. What works for me....can be useless for someone else.

I have the joint pain, extreme fatigue at times, dry mouth and eyes

and loss of concentration with brain fog.


Glad to meet you. Your English is just fine........if I attempted to use

what little Spanish I know I would not be near as good as you with your English.



shelly",4,5,178535043,5903,"Interesting - my ANA was/is high, but SS antibodies negative. Rheumatologist still went with SS diagnosis. 
Did the GI / IBS go away, or is it still there?",1,5,788835044,5903,My blood work was not diffinitive. I was DX'd on symptoms.,1,3,51534945,5896,"Lou, 

I want to be a support to you as well. This is a place where many people with SS can offer support. I too am having a very difficult time with a new medical worry. We are so fortunate to be able to reach out to others who are sad and worried about SS. It would be very good if you had the support of your family but I know the challenges because I do not have the support of my family either, so I understand. I do have one cousin who will talk to me on the phone for a while, but she has other things to do and she can not give more. 

In the past, I have hidden from SS but it has only hurt me to not stay aware of my symptoms and not reach out for help like I can now do here. I am going to be more open about my health and ask for the help I need. It will be good to hear you share with us. I know that eating healthy and getting great amounts of sleep is very important. Walking in beautiful nature is also important to remind you of what is beautiful in life, get exercise and be in the world. The love of family and friends is my greatest challenge. I help others but getting their help without an argument is a challenge. I am still trying to figure out how to get the help I need. My pets are a great comfort just to be loved unconditionally. I hope to read new post about how you are doing. 

Take care, Rebecca",5,5,788234948,5896,"Lou,

Welcome!Ã¥Ã_ I hope this forum helps you as much as it has helped me.Ã¥Ã_ When I was first diagnosed, I didn't know a single soul with this illness.Ã¥Ã_ I came here and immediately met people like me and also people much sicker than I was.Ã¥Ã_ I stopped feeling so alone.

There is great advice here, too.Ã¥Ã_ I have learned so much and my quality of life has improved with the advice I received here.Ã¥Ã_ We discuss just about everything.

Glad you found us!

Kathy",4,1,160734951,5896,"Hi girls!

I write this lines to express my gratitude for your time and your words. I have primary SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren.
Right now i am suffering bad days because of chronic fatigue. I have to do really efforts to leave the bed, but the worst of all is the emotional lonesomeness feeling.
My parents are not a support.Ã¥Ã_ They always avoid to talk about my ilness and diminish importance to this circunstance.
Other family, I donÃŒÃ¢Ã¥Â«t have. My family are my pets: my dogs and my cats. Friends really diffincult to find, only people who cross in your life
Right now I am finishing a master degree.Ã¥Ã_ I have had thinking on leaving Spain, but I feel really tire about everything.Ã¥Ã_ I know that the most reasoning in my situation is to be freelance.Ã¥Ã_ Any company will hire a person with my personal situation about my age (40) and my illness.

I promise to write more when I feel better.

What about you? I will be happy to read about yours life experiences.

I am happy to find this forum!

The easiest, single thing that has helped me the most, with brain fog and fatigue, is taking Vitamin D3 supplements.Ã¥Ã_ Research articles are now showing that getting your blood levels up to 70,000 is important for people with autoimmune disorders.Ã¥Ã_ This is much higher than previous recommendations.

Most of us have found rheumatologists who can help with medications and blood tests. Many of us had to go to more than one doctor to find one who understood what we were facing. And some of us travel a ways to visit a good one!Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I hope you're able to locate the resources you need nearby.

My husband and I are dreaming (planning?) to visit Galicia. We love the music there.

So glad you found our group. You will learn a lot about Sjogren's and make new friends here. We all understand your feelings and your symptoms. I hope that you will soon be able to find some relief.

The fatigue is very difficult. I work full time and struggle to get through the work day. Maybe freelancing will be a good thing for you. What type of freelance work do you do?

I adapted a letter a few years ago for people with Sjogren's to share with their unsupportive friends and family. Many people have shared it and told me that it helped. I don't have it with me at home right now, but you can find it on my blog..(SjoDryandparched)..the website addressÃ¥Ã_ is SjoDry.wordpress.com

I will try to add some information about my case.Ã¥Ã_ Right now I do not have any pills prescribed to treat my pain and my fatigue.

SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren Patients' Group (NÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_cleo de SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren) is one of the core groups at the Portuguese League Against Rheumatic Diseases (LPCDR) and it is the only patients' association devoted to SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren's Syndrome in Portugal.
With LPCDR's total support, since 2012 this specific patients' group has been promoting awareness on SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren's Syndrome amongst decision makers, the general public, rheumatologists and GP's.
Our aims are to provide information and support to patients and carers, to raise awareness amongst health care providers and health professionals, including doctors, and to promote a better understanding of SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren's Syndrome.
Being the only Portuguese patients' group, we also provide support and information to other Portuguese speakers through our closed group on Facebook or internet page at LPCDR's website.

Hope this helps.

Cheers!",1,1,237435040,5903,"OK - saw the Rheumatologist yesterday who confirmed SS. For me, over the past 2 yrs, have had 4 major groups of symptoms : 

* GI issues - randomly started having IBS type stuff (cramps, diarrhoea, GI discomfort). Had tons of tests, imaging, & scopes to rule out colon diseases. 

* Had 2 or 3 bouts of finger joint flares akin to R/A. Tests ID'd elevated ANA but no rheumatoid factor etc. 

* Dry eyes - very dry. Started adding drops 2 times a day or so most days (with the occassional few days where all was fine)

* Weird discomfort below right shoulder blade akin to gallbladder issues.

Anyway - the Rheumatologist didn't see anything too alarming in the blood work besides the elevated ANA, but still went with SS. I have a follow-up test in 6 months, and am doing another ultrasound to see if the SS is causing grief with my gallbladder. 

Some stats on me:
* Male
* Mid 40's
* Caucasian

I have 2 different personal humidifiers and I love them both.Ã¥Ã_ My first one is an Air-O-Swiss and I bought it on Amazon.Ã¥Ã_ It is still running strong and I'm going on my third year with it.Ã¥Ã_ I use it frequently.Ã¥Ã_ It is very portable and it sits on my desk at work.Ã¥Ã_ It's really cute and runs on a bottle of water!Ã¥Ã_ You can use tap water but I always use bottled water because it lasts longer without all the hard water deposits clogging it up.

I bought a second personal humidifier that is a Violife and I actually like it a little better.Ã¥Ã_ It is also portable and runs on bottled water.Ã¥Ã_ I bought it on sale at Younkers but I'm pretty sure that I saw it on Amazon, too.

They are awesome to pack in a suitcase for travel, etc.Ã¥Ã_ I never leave home without one!!!

I really need one!,2,1,744435139,5922,"I've not been here for a long time but I'm back. I've moved to a new area of Scotland and have a new rheumatologist. I had high hopes for him but sadly I've not got far because all my autoantibodies are negative although my rheumatoid factor was a weak positive during 2011 - when all symptoms pointed to RA which I was diagnosed and treated for. 

After a nightmarish year of severe drug reactions, pneumonia and a gallbladder operation which led to severe abcess in the wound site last summerÃ¥Ã_ - we relocated and all has improved for us in terms of access to a bigger world, more work opportunities and generally feeling happier. 

However I'm still suffering from a widespread, clinically diagnosed small fibre neuropathy, have paired Oligloclonal bands in my spinal fluid, high total protein levels and raised inflammatory markers. I'm still terribly tired daily and have a weird feeling of numbness in my feet and dizziness/ imbalance issues, which improved instantly with steroids but are back again now I'm off these, so I seem to lose my bearings often while walking - changes in flooring and lighting throw me and I have to find hard objects to touch in order to feel confident about where I can walk. 

Also my eyes are horribly dry despite no problems showing up in the Schirners's test five months ago. My optician said that this test isn't a good one and I have severe eye dryness in his tear break up test. My BP is increasingly soaring so I'm now about to start a second hypertension medicine and I've just had a clear cystoscopy because of microscopic haematuria. Another sign of a connective tissue disease - but my rheumatologist does not believe I have a connective tissue disease because of my negative autoabtibodies. He thinking a my problems may be endocrine or neurological still.He hasn't pushed me off his list and will see me in six months time because of the previous RA diagnosis.

Meanwhile I've been referred back to neurology and also last week I saw an oral surgeon who told me that he felt all my troubles were neuropathic abd felt most likely autoimmune but because my mouth isn't especially dry he didn't want to do a lip biopsy as he felt it would most probably be negative andÃ¥Ã_ may hinder me getting the support and possible treatments might need. The neuropathy is bad in my gums, lips and left cheek and eye now as well as both legs and arms - hands particularly bad for burning just now. 

So I'm resigned to my tingling, increasingly numb, disorientating world but my latest trouble is vaginalÃ¥Ã_ dryness and this is new. Should I mention it the rheumatologist or neurologist - or is it just another coincidental symptom that an ageing, post menopausal thing a woman of 53 should expect perhaps?",1,5,206035143,5922,"So who's given you the sero-negative Sjogren's Dx?Ã¥Ã_ This is great...will the rheumy recognize this and treat accordingly for you?Ã¥Ã_ I sure hope so.

I've followed/commented on your frustrating health crisis on both here and the neurotalk and felt some of your doctors just refuse to look outside the box.Ã¥Ã_ It certainly can be sero-neg Sjogren's, but also just the neuropathy itself that causes the dry mouth/eyes.Ã¥Ã_ Maybe the notes from the oral surgeon to the rheumy will include a possible Dx of sero-neg Sjogren's!!Ã¥Ã_ 

Keep us posted!",3,2,206935147,5922,"Thanks so much but no no no I've only self diagnosed with seronegative Sjogrens - it makes so much more sense than idiopathic small fibre neuropathy with strange coincidental others added on? I've always been overly dry in eyes, skin etc and it feels to me as if the dryness has now turned largely inward - just beneath the skin and down into my nerve fibres. Gosh that sounds really bonkers doesn't it?!Ã¥Ã_ :o 

I don't think the lovely oral surgeon will suggest Sjogrens to my doctors because he didn't suggest it to me - rather he suggested an immune mediated neuropathy. But I'm personally sure it's Sjogrens although I take your point that the SFN could be causing the dryness rather than Sjogrens - certainly my toes, which get freezing cold whiteness and Morton's neuromas, have gone all dry and wrinkled on the joints which is kind of weird! 

Thanks for reading my long posts on both here and on NeuroTalk.

Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I'm going on my 3rd year reading posts on this forum.Ã¥Ã_ I still feel like a newbie as I still don't understand about 75% of the conditions people talk about they believe are related to SjS.Ã¥Ã_ I accept their convictions..I just don't understand.Ã¥Ã_ btw:Ã¥Ã_ of that 75% of related conditions I fail to understand....another 50% I've never heard of.Ã¥Ã_ 

Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I am saying that as I know nothing...or very little.Ã¥Ã_ The little I know is what I read here.Ã¥Ã_ I thought (because I've read it here) seronegative SjS is when blood tests do not confirm but lip biopsy DOES confirm.Ã¥Ã_ Thus, seronegative.

Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_In understanding MY dx, I was told I had 2ndary SjS due to several AI diseases.Ã¥Ã_ Well...from this board one is 2ndary ONLY when one is diagnosed RA and SjS.Ã¥Ã_ In my case the hematologist who ""assigned"" Hashimoto's is the one who dxed that.Ã¥Ã_ I think she was wrong.Ã¥Ã_ Will see my rheumy next week and will ask.
Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_This takes me back to my belief the biggest problem dxing and treating SjS is lack of knowledge among doctors.Ã¥Ã_ 

Have a good day mat,
c3",2,5,32635163,5922,"Well I often wonder if doctors aren't overly simplistic about immunlogy and connective tissue diseases because of research funding and the cost of medications etc - which influences diagnostic criteria. I have Hashimoto's as well as RA and I think the RA, which has been and gone for me, was actually secondary to the Hashimoto's. I've not had a lip biopsy although I have been offered one. I was told that it was unlikely to be positive and even if it was there is no treatment for Sjogren's beyond those drugs I've already tried and failed to tolerate (severe allergies rather than unpleasant side effects) for RA.

So I know exactly what you mean about being baffled by the secondaries business. My rheumatkogidf suggested that I might need to take my symptoms to an endocrinologist but my GP refused to refer me saying she didn't see how this was relevant. So I'm no wiser than you at the end of the day! Mat",2,5,206035166,5922,"This is what I understand to be the difference between Primary and Seconday Sjogren's:Ã¥Ã_ Primary Sjogren's occurs by itself and secondary Sjogren's occurs when another connective tissue disease is present. So, if one has Scleroderma, Lupus, RA, or some other connective tissue disease, then one is classified as having Secondary Sjogren's. However, the Sjogren's Foundation is trying to get this terminology changed/dropped because it was originally instituted for research purposes and it really does not matter if one has Primary or Seconday Sjogren's in terms of disease severity or treatment. 

From Dr. Jody Hargrove, Rheumatologist:

""Q. What is the difference between Primary Sjogren?s versus Secondary Sjogren's?""

""A. Sjogren's is usually classified by a clinician as either primary or secondary. Primary Sjogren's occurs by itself and secondary Sjogren's occurs when another connective tissue disease is present. However, this classification does not always correlate with the severity of symptoms or complications. Primary Sjogren's and Secondary Sjogren's patients can all experience the same level of discomfort, complications and seriousness of their disease.""

Sjogren's can affect much more than the exocrine glands. Many people have systemic complication from various organs and systems being attacked by Sjogren's. Here is a chart that details all of the possible complications from Sjogren's:

https://www.sjogrens.org/home/about-sjogrens/symptoms


Peripheral Neuropathy, including Small Fiber Neuropathy, are often the first symptoms Sjogren's patients get. If all other causes for the neuropathy have been ruled out, then Sjogren's can very well be the cause. Autonomic Neuropathy can also be caused by Sjogren's.

Since 40-50% of people with Sjogren's do not have the Sjogren's antibodies, no one can say you do not have Sjogren's just because you do not have the antibodies.

Should I mention it the rheumatologist or neurologist - or is it just another coincidental symptom that an ageing, post menopausal thing a woman of 53 should expect perhaps?

Vaginal dryness could be due to age or post-menopause circumstances, but still worth mentioning to your rheumatologist and neurologist as part of the big picture for diagnosis, but also to your gyno who might have a treatment suggestion for the isolated issue.

I'm pre-menopausal, but my gyno said if vag is dry on the outside, put Vaseline on the area. If dry on the inside, get Replens (in the feminine products aisle) which is basically Vaseline in an applicator. Use a pantyliner so you don't ruin your undies.

""This is amazing to me---because the dx of ""connective tissue disease""Ã¥Ã_ is not an autoimmune disease. ""Ã¥Ã_ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I agree with you that, technically, the dx of ""connective tissue disease""Ã¥Ã_ is not an autoimmune disease, but from what I read, it seems that most of the time when doctors (especially Rheumatologists) are talking about connective tissue disease, they are referring to an Autoimmune Disease. (I also agree that we have a puzzling disease and I don't think the puzzle will be solved during my lifetime.)

Cleveland Clinic has a good description/definition and much more about connective tissue diseases. I believe all of the diseases they describe, are Autoimmune. 

""What are connective tissue diseases?""

""A connective tissue disease is any disease that affects the parts of the body that connect the structures of the body together. Connective tissues are made up of two proteins: collagen and elastin. Collagen is a protein found in the tendons, ligaments, skin, cornea, cartilage, bone, and blood vessels. Elastin is a stretchy protein that resembles a rubber band and is the major component of ligaments and skin. When a patient has a connective tissue disease, the collagen and elastin are inflamed. The proteins and the body parts they connect are harmed.
What are the different types of connective tissue diseases?

There are several different types of connective tissue diseases. They can be inherited or caused by environmental factors. Connective tissue diseases include, but are not limited to:

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) - Rheumatoid arthritis is one of the most common connective tissue diseases and can be inherited. RA is an autoimmune disease, meaning the immune system attacks its own body. In this systemic disorder, immune cells attack and inflame the membrane around joints. It also can affect the heart, lungs, and eyes. It affects many more women than men (an estimated 71% of cases).

Scleroderma - an autoimmune condition that causes scar tissue to form in the skin, internal organs (including the GI tract), and small blood vessels. It affects women three times more often than men throughout life, occurring at a rate of 15 times greater for women during childbearing years.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly called Wegener?s granulomatosis - A form of vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that affects the nose, lungs, kidneys and other organs.

Churg-Strauss syndrome - A type of autoimmune vasculitis that affects cells in the blood vessels of the lungs, gastrointestinal system, skin, and nerves.

Systemic lupus erythematosus lupus (SLE) - A disease that can cause inflammation of the connective tissue in every organ of the body, from the brain, skin, blood, to the lungs. It is nine times more common in women than men.

Microscopic polyangiitis - An autoimmune disease that affects cells in blood vessels in organs throughout the body. It is a rare condition.

Polymyositis/dermatomyositis - A disease characterized by inflammation and degeneration of the muscles. When the condition also affects the skin, it is called dermatomyositis.

How do connective tissue diseases affect the lungs and breathing?

One of the most serious impacts of connective tissue disease is on the pulmonary system. The types of connective tissue disease mentioned above can involve the lungs and affect breathing.""

http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases_conditions/hic-connective-tissue-diseases",1,5,150535175,5922,"Thanks Jasper for explaining connective tissue disease. The way I always remembered it from nurses training was that these diseases affect the tissues and the ""glue"" that binds the tissues together.

All the issues we have with these autoimmune connective tissue diseases are caused by the mistake the body makes by attacking these tissues. The result is that the body is basically trying to kill us off by destroying the normal functioning of these cells. Just think of the blisters and rashes we get from autoimmune skin disease. The autoimmune response is trying to destroy normal function and ir screws up our skin bad. Just a little info---the skin is the largest organ of the body. Some of the jobs that it does is to help control temperature and hold our body together plus protect us against infection.

As complicated as autoimmune diseases are they basically all have one thing in common. No matter what symptoms they cause, they are trying to kill us off. The immune response is destroying us by mistake. The immune system has gone nuts and is attacking us. Immune system thinks that we (our body) is a foreign substance out to cause illness and harm. Thus the attack begins. It is like the immune system is our friend until it goes nuts and mistakenly trys to kill us off by making antibodies that are what destroy our organs and tissues. Well, that was as clear as mud!!!! Irish",2,5,53035179,5922,"its always so interesting to read your comments! 
i would like to make a question: when i worked for an european association that gives help to people who lost relatives in car accidents, i knew that many of them developed cancer or autoimmune deseases. this came, they said, from the psycological schock of loosing their relatives. iÃ¥Ã_ firmly believe that brain has a big power on our body, just thinkÃ¥Ã_ about blood pressure or heart rate that goes up for fear or emotion or even to our dear saliva that in our good old times could go awayÃ¥Ã_ before an exam. so i wonder if my sjogren comes ALSO from the schock of loosing my son and i ask u if any of u had big psycological schocks in your life. i dont say that everyone can have sj from that but may be a terrible stress can "" push"" this desease to come out, ciao",2,5,175335183,5922,"They don't know for sure what causes some people to get an autoimmune disease and others are unaffected. The truth of the matter is the researchers feel that there is a predisposition to the autoimmune issues. A stressor can surely push us over the edge.

I have no doubt that the loss of your son could have been the stressor. There might have been other smaller stressors around the time of your low that could have added to your limit. Because of the severe stress of your loss you would have been unaware of them because of your grief.

I had a skull fracture and concussion when 21 and I sweat that kicked in my myasthenia gravis and sjogrens. My hubby said I was never the same after that accident. Good luck. Irish",3,5,53035202,5931,"Soooooooo frustrated. Rode two hours to the new rheumy and two back (thank god my blessed husband drove) to see the new rheumy only to be told my SjS is under control, I just have osteoarthritis. Just keep taking Tylenol he said and gave me a scrip for Tramadol.

My white counts, leukocytes and some other cyte are low, but he doesn't know why. He disagrees with the hematologist who told me on my first visit in the fall that it's because of my SjS. My PCP said my counts can be normal so I should follow up. Now I have to go two hours back next Monday to see the hematologist (we can't keep one where I live). 

On top of it I maybe have issues with my thoracic or lumbar spine (that's what the neurologist thinks after I spoke with him about sensation that feels like I can't expand my lungs around my ribs). Couldn't feel the tines on my feet when he used them and had spots on my back where I couldn't feel. So this week I get to have an MRI.

I should be grateful I suppose that my Sjs is apparently not a problem and that I just have osteoarthritis. However, as I told my PCP in a message, I feel like crap when my counts are low and I just can't believe this isn't all related.

And I told the rheumy that tylenol bothers my stomach (not possible he said). So now I have to contact the gastroenterologist to find out why I'm regurgitating acid up my esophagus (sorry to be so graphic). And the rheumy ordered lung function testing, I said I'm not going until I talk with the gastro folks because maybe it's just GERD.

I am still going to PT for my shoulder and still have numbness there and in my hand.

I can excuse the family doctors for some of their opinions because they supposedly haven't studied the connective tissue diseases as much as a rheumatologist. These diseases are Sjogrens, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, etc. The rheumatologist don't seem to be as proactive as evidenced by so many peoples posts on this site.

Yes, the blood can get screwed up by autoimmune diseases as it affects the bone marrow which manufactures the blood cells. I have problems with anemia and other low counts that go up and down.

We do not fit into their little box of diagnostic tools and results so nothing is wrong with us and we can not possibly be having a flare or pain or anything to do with inflammation. 

Personally, I think there are many lab markers and they are not using most of them to test for inflammation. There are many, many lab tests they run in trials and studies that they are not running on us. Plus, I think they have not yet discovered all of the specific markers that get elevated when people with Sjogren's have flares or inflammation. So they are using general markers, which may or may not be elevated when we have inflammation and flares. 

I recall that when I had Systemic Vasculitis my sed rate was way up. That was in 1993-94 and I did not routinely get copies of my labs then so I have no idea what else was elevated. 

Since then, nothing is ever been elevated. In 2013 I had bilateral lower leg, ankle, and feet edema for 6 months and nothing was elevated. I also had bilateral calf erythema at the same time. When I go into a flare, nothing is elevated, but I feel like crap (fatigue, no energy, lower extremity edema, more aches and pains in muscles and joints, etc.). I had pneumonia in 2014 and felt like crap for a month, and none of my inflammatory markers were up. 

So, as far as I am concerned, the tests they currently use are not measuring our inflammation. I think someone needs to do some studies and find out what markers are elevated in Sjogren's patients.

Not sure if I should visit a rheumatologist. There's so much info it's all confusing. I also have a history of psoriasis which too is autoimmune. Any help is appreciated.",1,5,161435444,5971,"Hello Wal and welcome to the forum.

Like you, I had symptoms years before they come up with the sjogrens & RA

diagnosis over 5 years ago. Approximately 20 years ago my GP

thought I may have MS but in a few months they disappeared. I had dry eye

and dry mouth for at least 15 years.Ã¥Ã_ One of my earlier joint problems

was my toes and elbows were painful and tender.


I hope your GP will refer you on to a rheumatologist b/c you do not

have to have positive labs to get a sjogrens diagnosis....it can be made

on your symptoms.Ã¥Ã_ Plaquenil is a first line drug of choice to treat

sjogrens and it was a blessing to me and I still take it along with

methotrexate.

I had positive labs to diagnose me.......it took all those years

before a light bulb went off in my GP's head to run the tests finally.


Biotene has really good mouth products to help with the dryness,

I too use Privident per my dentist. I also use sugarless hard candy,

gum with xylitol and lots of water. I tried Restasis eye drops to produce

more tears for 4 months but it didn't help me although it does help lots

of people. I used Pilocarpine to produce more saliva and it really worked,

however I had side effects from it and had to quit......but again, it has

helped others quite well. I ended up having my lower tear ducts cauterized shut

after having success with temporary plugs.


Just giving info above to give you some ideas on sjogrens. 

Have you seen a eye dr to have your tear quanity/quality checked.

Armed with your symptoms, your dentist findings and possibly even an

eye dr results......your GP should refer you on to rheumy. In insist on it !!

You will have to become your best and own personal advocate.




Let us know what happens.........keep posting.


shelly",3,5,178535446,5971,"Welcome to the board, Wal.

I agree with eye2dry about seeing an ophthalmologist to determine amount and quality of tears. They are easy tests and if the opth determines you're eyes are dry, can suggest some remedies and prepare a letter to your PCP (with a copy to you) stating your eyes are dry.

You can also ask if your dentist will do a spit volume test. If you are low on saliva, your dentist can prescribe Salagen or Evoxac which help you produce more saliva. The dentist can also prepare a letter to your PCP (with a copy to you) stating you are low on saliva.

If the opth and dentist solutions do not suffice to treat your symptoms, you can take their letters along with test results to a rheumatologist who will likely want to run more blood tests and maybe also urine tests. If they come back negative, your doctor may still be willing to provide additional treatment based on opth's and dentist's findings plus your other reported symptoms.

If your tests are negative, the benefit of having reports from opth and dentist are that they support your claims rather than just self-reporting.

I would take ibuprofen for and pain and also had a hot water bottle on my neck a lot. I eventually saw a different doctor who diagnosed me with hypothyroidism. This itself can cause some problems with the voice. I was diagnosed years later with Hashimotos or autoimmune thyroid disease. This can cause the swelling in the vocal chords also.

Another problem that can affect the voice and cause the hoarseness and pain is the lack of saliva plus reflux disease that is common in people with Sjogrens. It took me years to get over this hoarseness and I still have no real clue as to what caused it but autoimmune is most likely the primary cause.

I was miserable with this as my voice would come and go and by the end of the day it hurt a lot to speak and it was hard to be like this at work. Communication was a huge part of my job.

None of these ideas are stand alones.Ã¥Ã_ At night I will take a sip of water (when I wake up) and THEN I dab the Biotene gel on my tongue. I do not dab too much.Ã¥Ã_ Then I spread it over my palate..and to me it feels so good.

This is a condition I am convinced is an esoteric disease within the specialties who find it and dx it.Ã¥Ã_ This is evidenced by what I have read on this forum.Ã¥Ã_ The time span between suspicions of the disease and confirmed dx is so long as so many doctors have zero clue as to what it is....then there is the LARGE %age of doctors who might think of SjS...but know nothing beyond eye and mouth dryness.Ã¥Ã_ I'd be embarrassed to tell you what my ENT told me ""solutions"" were AFTER I took my test results to him of SjS.Ã¥Ã_ He had treated my chronic sialadenitis a few months short of five full years.Ã¥Ã_ I am 73 and he is about 6 or 7 years younger than I.Ã¥Ã_ It is comical what he said.Ã¥Ã_ 

For those of you who work with a dx, good luck and more power to you.Ã¥Ã_ I did work with it...I know I had it.Ã¥Ã_ Too many symptoms.Ã¥Ã_ I just didn't know ""it"" was anything.Ã¥Ã_ My progressive symptom was fatigue.Ã¥Ã_ I thought it was due to age.Ã¥Ã_ And...the truth is, it probably was.

Those of you who are so smart and have figured it out, the bottom line is managing your comfort level---for each part of your body affecting you.Ã¥Ã_ With dx, that is all your doctors do:Ã¥Ã_ send you out from specialist to specialist as the symptoms are part of dozens of conditions.Ã¥Ã_ Treatment is same no matter what the cause is.

I am not saying this is easy:Ã¥Ã_ I am saying it's manageable.Ã¥Ã_

Hope it helps!",1,5,799635765,6016,"I can't really give more info except for personal.Ã¥Ã_ When I was dxed with GERD it was after the gastro had discovered an NSAID ulcer.Ã¥Ã_ Medication for a year closed it...and then he Rxed Prilosec.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I told him I had not suffered the reflux after I had started that med for the ulcer.Ã¥Ã_ But he insisted. This was a bit over 20 years ago.

When I was dxed with SjS...and was told and subsequently read symptoms, etc, I began to realize I didn't have reflux...it was related to swallowing probs along with that food coming up.Ã¥Ã_ In fact, I recall describing my irritation so differently than others described GERD.Ã¥Ã_ I dutifully took the Prilosec and eventually Nexium.

Two + years since SjS dx.Ã¥Ã_ About a year and a half ago I started skipping the Nexium.Ã¥Ã_ NO symptoms.Ã¥Ã_ I took myself off it completely a year ago.Ã¥Ã_ No probs.Ã¥Ã_ Another curious event in my life with SjS.Ã¥Ã_ To be fair and honest, I can't eat a whole lot of what I once did.Ã¥Ã_ I ascribe some of the absence of symptoms to that.Ã¥Ã_ Overall...I am not sure I ever had honest GERD.Ã¥Ã_ 

Over the decades I have had so many colonoscopies and endoscopies done because of that one ulcer.Ã¥Ã_ Nothing.Ã¥Ã_ My esophagus has had blemishes, but not a thing in my colon...or stomach.Ã¥Ã_ 

Recently my internist told me I MUST take nexium daily NOW as I am on low dose prednisone. He says it makes no difference if I had one NSAID ulcer or 20...it makes me susceptible to them.Ã¥Ã_ (He did NOT add ""at my age"" but know he was thinking it.)

Recently I had a bout of stomach ""stuff"" to which I expelled blood for 2 days along with mucous from my colon.Ã¥Ã_ It is something that happens every time I have these ""spells"".Ã¥Ã_ I was surprised to witness the amount mucous in my system.Ã¥Ã_ I mean ...was pleased/thrilled.Ã¥Ã_ 

When you said ""bile"" it hit me....much of the time I was supposed to be having reflux all I had was bile.Ã¥Ã_ Don't know if that is anything, just commenting.

And to the throat--I have chronic throat clearing and try to take sips of water when having a conversation or talking on the phone.Ã¥Ã_ I started this years ago...literally 30 or more years ago.Ã¥Ã_ Have been told I had a tic due to it.Ã¥Ã_ Of course, now I understand why.Ã¥Ã_ I am retired now and a widow.Ã¥Ã_ I don't ""conversate"" daily for long or regular periods.Ã¥Ã_ That helps me...AND Biotene Oral Balance Gel.

Best to you...and that tooth.Ã¥Ã_ Don't envy you.

Since I am also on humidified BiPap, during winter I up the setting to 4.5 so I get more direct humidity when I sleep.",2,5,92035970,6038,"This is pretty normal for a Sjogrens patient. We just don't have enough mucus production to keep our mucus membranes moist. If a person has a septal perforation the thick mucus we do make can get literally plugged up in that little hole and cause more problems.

The humidifiers are a necessity and the nasal gel and saline drops are also something we need to carry with us and use often. Also, irrigating our nose helps to clean out the thick, crusty mucus.

Docs advise not to use tap water as it can contain bacterias that can cause some bad infections. It is advised to boil distilled water for 4-5 minutes and let it cool and then place it in refrigerator in a container. I put a cup of this water in a bigger measuring cup so that you can heat it 25 seconds or so to warm it up slightly. Add the soda/salt mixture and then you can irrigate with the neti pot or the irrigation bottle that you can buy at Walmart or Walgrens. I think Walmart is cheaper.

You can also buy the soda/salt packets that come 50 to a box separately. I think they are about 8$ at Walmart. Doing this a couple of times a day really helps keep the nose clean and cuts down on the infections. Make sure to keep things clean and wash with warm soap and water often. When I have an infection I will buy a new spray bottle to prevent spreading the infection back to myself. I have been irrigating my nose since the year 2000 and, yes, it does get old,but it helps.

life...what a pain!!!!

Gursie",4,1,150635976,6038,"Dear Gurs,

I know about the drying effect, but it's all a trade off, isn't it?

I take that Macqui berry supplement, and 2800 mgÃ¥Ã_ of fish oil, as well as Salagen.Ã¥Ã_ Then I have the nasal saline, and naso-cort, and the eye spray for the middle of the night.Ã¥Ã_ And generic Mucinex.Ã¥Ã_ As long as I can keep my sinuses clear, I can breathe through my nose and all is well.

I take so many supplements....I wonder if they are all worth it, but they aren't doing any harm, and I don't know.

One of my worst flare symptoms is itching, burning skin.Ã¥Ã_ I scratch my forearms at night, while I'm sleeping, leaving long bleeding marks.Ã¥Ã_ 

Gurs, there's no way to tell for me except trial and error.Ã¥Ã_ My dryness hasn't change over the years.Ã¥Ã_ My 'Sjogren's' as you know, isn't technically diagnosed, and I have NO AUTO-ANTIBODIES at all.Ã¥Ã_ My immune system attacks my body directly, and my parasympathetic system crashed in 2002, but hasn't gotten worse.Ã¥Ã_ So I'm lucky, to say the least.

The major assault began then, I believe, on the peroneal, axonal nerves in my legs, and culminated in 2010 with profound neuropathy.Ã¥Ã_ That's why my new braces are so amazing, they allow me a freedom to walk again.

And in the interim I lost hearing from Meniere's, became anemic, developed IC, had three abscessed molars and now I have lung damage as well.Ã¥Ã_ And of course the CVID.Ã¥Ã_ And the IVIG causes unbearable, increasing flares with 2.5 mg Medrol daily

So I am constantly balancing one set of problems against another, as I know you are.

I'm just getting over a head/chest cold.Ã¥Ã_ And I seem to recovering WITHOUT any bacterial infection in my sinuses/lungs.Ã¥Ã_ But who knows?Ã¥Ã_ I just take it a day at a time.

You are diabetic so that can make a difference when it comes to some alternative treatments.

With urinary infections there can sometimes be a bacteria that is almost impossible to treat and have a cure. Diabetes can add to the problem because of the fact that diabetics have more bladder infections due to the higher blood sugars.

Sometimes people will have antibiotics ordered everyday and change the antibiotic every few weeks. This may or may not be a help. Also, some docs have given vitamin C to patients to change the acidity of the urine which in turn helps kill of the bacteria. Maybe a second opinion would help. Good luck.

The usefulness of cranberry products in preventing recurrent UTIs has not been clearly established, although it is still widely used and prescribed to patients. The latest Cochrane Database review concluded that cranberry products cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of recurrent UTIs [6], although there are many good-quality studies that clearly showed its efficacy in selected patients.

We believe that D-mannose may be a useful agent for the prevention of recurrent UTIs but further clinical trials will be necessary

The way my doctor does it.Ã¥Ã_ I took my night meds a few hours early before the prep. The night before, you take your first dose of the ?prep stuff? with enough water to fill up an elephant at 9pm.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_(It was three really large glasses of water that had the medicine in it and you could spread that out over an hour).Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_You couldn?t fit more water into yourself if you tried.

You could ask if you could suck on a lozenge up until the procedure. Then spit it out before they knock you out.

You will not be out for a very long period of time so your sinus passages may not get dry. But you could do a nasal saline rinse with a Nailmed or netti pot in the morning prior to the procedure. That may help.

Did any of your other symptoms increase when the fatigue increased?

I find that when I am in an Autoimmune flare I have severe fatigue, which I do not normally have when not in a flare). It took me a while to figure out that the episodes of severe fatigue, brain fog, increased symptoms, edema, were all caused by going into a flare. The flares would come on and they would stay for a couple of months. Then subside for a month or two and then they would be back.

My Rheumatologist prescribed a 20 day taper to take when I get the flares (Prednisone 20 mg x 5 days, 15 mg x 5 days, 10 mg x 5 days, 5 mg x 5 days, then stop). The Prednisone taper stops the flare(s) within days and I am normal again for awhile (or, at least, fairly normal, and no severe fatigue). 

IF you are having flares, then I would think that treating the flares (the actual cause of the fatigue) would be a better option thanÃ¥Ã_ treating the fatigue (the result of a flare). Of course, I don't know if your fatigue is from a flare or some other cause, but IF it is a flare causing the fatigue, then, to me, treating the flare would be a better option than treating a symptom(severe fatigue) of the flare. 

While the various drugs for fatigue may help keep you awake, they do have side effects, and they are not really getting at the cause of the fatigue.

Anyone else ever had that problem with manufacturing changes on their prescriptions?",1,5,142036288,6093,"Yes! It is maddening. I have had that 2 or 3 times.

Crazy.

Take care.
SjoDry",4,1,142336290,6093,Hi!Ã¥Ã_ I am looking at your symptoms and see you and I are a lot a like.Ã¥Ã_ I faced Walgreen's with the problem and got a hold of my doctor immediately.Ã¥Ã_ I now have the right ones in my possession!Ã¥Ã_ I had no idea that could happen.Ã¥Ã_ GoodÃ¥Ã_ luck with your horse pills.,4,3,142036327,6098,"Hi there,

Have a high liver test (170) so off I go from Methotrexate/Folate and today Rheumy. suggested Benlysta.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I searched it on this site and saw a few comments.

Any new info. or experiences from anyone?Ã¥Ã_ 

I've just paid $1,500.00 maximum individual for the July1 thru June 30th insurance year so there would be no co-pay for me for now but the whole IV thing sounds creepy....and I can't say that I'd stick with it so I then ask myself...why start putting that stuff in my body?
Ã¥Ã_
Yet again, every time I go to another med. in the autoimmune journey it worries me more than the previous one.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_

It's the constant flaring sensation in my tissues...that eternal malaise that has me today saying yes to my Doctor when he suggested looking in to it.Ã¥Ã_ So I signed the paper that allows them to request it from my insurance.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_ good grief",1,5,345036330,6098,"so I then ask myself...why start putting that stuff in my body?
Ã¥Ã_
Yet again, every time I go to another med. in the autoimmune journey it worries me more than the previous one.

Well, we make this decision over and over again.

I have no advice, we are all so different.

Keep us posted.

Hugs,Ã¥Ã_ Elaine",2,1,1536332,6098,"Look up the details and then decide.Ã¥Ã_ Even though you said yes to the doctor, you can choose to say no later, if this doesn't feel right to do. 

I'm not arguing for or against that particular med - I don't know it well enough - just reminding you that you still can decide. 

But I get your point. When I first went on plaquenil, I thought ""Why am I taking this very dangerous drug?"".Ã¥Ã_ Now plaquenil seems so simple and straightforward and not very hazardous compared to some of the other things I've tried.",1,1,5636334,6098,"Rudytudy,

I research everything ad nauseaum..including any proposed meds. The descriptions scare me..but then at some point my symptoms are so bad, I'm willing to try almost anything. We are probably all a lot like this. 

Quality of life influences our medication decisions for sure. If we are miserable enough we bite the bullet & try a new med that we would otherwise never even consider.

The positive thing is that it is easy to stop the infusions if they aren't working for you. I don't love putting 4 needles in my stomach every other weekend for a 3.5 hour infusion of IVIG meds..but I do like not getting infections every 4-6 weeks so I do it.

I hope you are able to find something that works for you soon.
Take care.
SjoDry",4,1,142336340,6098,"I appreciate all your comments and will update down the road...

thanks",2,1,345036345,6098,"My doctor recommended Benlysta last July and again in November. He thinks if I calm the lupus, it may help my Sjogren's dryness symptoms. I'm really terrified of needles, so I haven't bit the bullet for IV infusions yet. 

Also, as SloDry said, qualify of life influences our treatment decisions. At this point, I'm concerned Benlysta may make my QOL worse rather than better. If my health declines or my symptoms become worse than my fear of needles, then I will request Benlysta. I'm hoping I can hold out long enough for self-injection injections, rather than monthly infusions, to get FDA approval. I think that delivery method is pretty far along in the trial process. For some reason, weekly quick injections in my stomach or leg at home seems better than monthly hour+ long infusions at my doctor's office.

Everyone's circumstances and concerns are different, though, so you may determine Benlysta is right for you. Many people have found it has improved their life immensely.

If you are on Facebook, there's a group you can join called Benlysta Buddies. It's a closed group (privacy setting) so admins must approve members, only group members can see posted content, and your membership in the group is not posted on your page. You can get more details by searching Facebook and group privacy settings. The group currently has more than 2700 members who are considering taking Benlysta, about to start taking Benlysta, or taking Benlysta, or have stopped taking Benlysta but stay in the group for support. The admins are good about approving new members pretty fast.

I am very happy for you. Celebrate a win! Take care.CK",5,1,237936439,6108,"Welcome. Some of us have posted what we are taking in our signature. I have had to use alternative therapies like meditation, reflexology, reiki, supplements and juicing. Management is key. When my girls were small I took care of them on my good days and used a sitter on bad days. It took me a number of years to reach a good level of management.

the youngest did not understand why things ended up the way they did. Now that she has been dealing with her own AI issues, she is using alternatives to better manage. She is doing better at management, at her younger age not because she listen to me but because she saw what worked for me.

While each of us is somewhat unique in how this disease affects us, weÃ¥Ã_ often find unique management solutions.

1. Don't panic- panic will make your symptoms worse.
2. Meditate - meditation reduces stress. Stress makes your symptoms worse.
3. The right supplements will support your immune system instead of suppressing it. (I believe auto immune diseases are caused by nano bacteria).
4. Welcome to the darkside. Too much sun will make your symptoms worse. Supplement with D3 daily.
5. There are 5 supplements that repair and support your mitochondria DNA. The will help you feel better.

good luck in your quest to manage this disease.",4,5,51536440,6108,"Welcome valleyfarm,

It seems that Lyme Disease may trigger earlier onset of Sjogren's (mostly a condition of mid-life women).

So, you've added another condition that the majority of people don't understand, and have little interest in.

Here, you will find understanding and caring.

We are all different, as we know.Ã¥Ã_ And those of us with Immune Disorders are MORE different, even from each other.

Those of us here represent the 'far end' of the range of Sjogren's (and other conditions).Ã¥Ã_ Most people with Sjogren's have some dryness, deal with it, and move on with life, often for a very very long time.Ã¥Ã_ So don't read our posts and feel 'doomed' to have all of our 'complications'.

THERE IS HOPE!Ã¥Ã_ 

Tuesday I sat next to someone having an infusion of Remicade one of the new biologicals that has given her a new lease on life with her many heartbreaking conditions.

So new drugs are in the pipeline.

My sister in law has Multiple Myeloma, a type of blood/bone cancer and has had it since 2009.Ã¥Ã_ She takes her medications, has blood checks periodically, and travels, loves her grandchildren, and generally carries on with life.Ã¥Ã_ 20 years ago she wouldn't have survived this long.

We also have techniques for managing symptoms, evaluating yourself and dealing with doctors.Ã¥Ã_ I imagine you have learned a LOT about doctors since you have Lyme Disease.

Fatigue is the biggest problem for most of us (for day to day coping) and I can't imagine 24/7 with two small children.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_But you're doing it!

Keep us posted.

Hugs,Ã¥Ã_ Elaine",3,5,1536442,6108,"Thank you, its nice to read the better ways to deal with issues and learning more and more all the time!Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_Fatigue is a huge problem for me, its super hard to keep up with the kiddos.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_

I moved on Dec. 18 after living in my old home of 38 years with my son who is renting it from my other son who bought it from me. My furniture came Dec. 28th and I have been slowing unpacking -- and I mean slowly. I ache all over, am weaker and wonder why I even bought a house at times. Balance issues are not good and I have to be very careful going to the basement to unpack the load of boxes down there. My kids come generally every day or I talk to one of them.

I an in the worst shape I have been in for years. Losing my hubby after caring for him all those years really stressed my body big time. Buying the first house and having deal fall through and then buying the second house was another stressor. My son moved in November 1st and my furniture went into storage on the 12th. Son moved the stuff out of the house that I had kept back and had to do it with the help of 2 nephews..My middle son was to help but he ended up with a bowel obstruction and surgery 2 days prior to my move. My oldest son says this surgery was premeditated to get out of work. HaHa! Obstruction was from severe scarring from a juicy appendectomy 25 years ago. Thankful to have this turn out ok.

I need all new windows in the house and my bathroom needs to be enlarged. All the rooms need to be painted--my bedroom is RED!!!! There is plumbing for a washer/dryer upstairs in little bedroom and that will be my den and sewing room also. I plan to do as much stuff as I can and will just keep plugging along. I have the usual bad mornings and some better as day progresses. I am lucky to get 2-3 hours of work done in little segments. I have all winter. Will get the upstairs more settled and then tend to downstairs.

I love the floor plan of the house. It is 2 blocks from HyVee and about 6 blocks from Walmart, Dollar store, 2 schools grand kids go to and about 5 blocks from the library. I have to drive but would be very happy if I would have a miracle and be able to do some walking. I am also one block from the fair grounds and my grandkids are thrilled about that. They will spend a few days with me at fair time I bet. I have been grieving more for my hubby since moving. I was so surrounded by my life and family and the sons business that I didn't seem to feel much change. Also, my hubby traveled much of our married life and I was used to him being gone for long periods of time. Out there it was like I was still waiting for him to come home.

Definitely a rough time of my life and I have to laugh at times that God can dump so much on this old lady. This is where the keeping on part comes in when we are sick in body and soul. We just keep on keeping on, don't we. Oh, my 2 cans of Mountain Dew each day help too. Thanks for listening to me vent. Irish

As for the question about living in my home after hubby passed away--I can't explain it but my hubby had been failing for so many years and the memories were mostly of illness related to that home. I was having trouble remembering the younger and healthier years. Also, there were so many things that needed to be done to the property that I felt overwhelmed by it all.

I had such great memories of the gorgeous sunsets from my kitchen window over those 38 years plus the memories of all the work we had done to the house and land. My hubby and I worked so well as a team and could almost read each others mind. Chronic illness of hubby and wife has a way of interfering with life as normal and is a hard thing to bare in both body, mind and soul.

I lived in the house with its memories and work that needed to be done until 17 months after his death when all of a sudden it was like ""it is time"" and all the pieces fell into place on the selling of the property to family. The whole thing went so fast and so many things took place since Sept 2015 that I just put myself in another space and place. No big decisions, just unpack and do one day at a time.Ã¥Ã_ Rest is what I try to do the most. Just crazy is all I can say. I'm too tired to call and talk to anyone so I don't. It is what it is.

I have always been a detail oriented person but this has been something else. You just keep on doing what needs to be done and shed tears when they come.

I am an independent soul and try not to ask for help unless I really need it. I figure that if I rest I can do some of these things later. I also have learned to not do anything strenuous or anything that could result in a fall when I don't feel up to it. My common sense comes in handy along with my bodies messages at these times. I wear my phone on my pocket so that if I get into trouble I can call the kids. Having 2 sons close by is great and my one DIL helps if I ask her. She and I are both independent spirits and she knows not to bother me and I know not to bother her.

Today I did call my son and let him know that I was not going out of town to the doctor (urgent care) as it was so cold and I didn't feel up to it. I do have an app[t with my regular doc on Friday and that will get me more help than urgent care, as all of you know. I did tell him that if anyone got to town I would appreciate a gal of milk--if not possible I would live. The good thing is I am 2 blocks from the HYVee store and they started delivering groceries to homes in Sept so I am not left in the lurch. Also deliver medications.

I also call and tell one of the boys when I am going out of town shopping, doctor, etc as we don't always talk every day but do end up texting one of them or their wives or kids every day. This way, if no one happens to hear from me they are alerted to the fact that they better pay attention. It is reverse teenager for me. HaHa. I don't mind cause I am so thankful to do what I am able to do with all this health stuff. Life can always be worse. I rested for almost 4 days and I think that I needed it big time. I have gotten more done with unpacking so it is beginning to look like there is hope. I don't think I can sleep in this bedroom until the red paint is painted over. It is so dark and depressing in this room.

Thanks for listening to me vent about my interesting life---not in the way it could be that is for sure. Hugs, Irish",5,1,53036559,6116,"Irish you are doing all you need to do. All I will say is we love you.

Thinking of you.Ã¥Ã_ It will eventually all get done.Ã¥Ã_ When is the plan to paint room?Ã¥Ã_ Being settled and feeling you can rest more will surely help.

I can't imagine going through all you're facing.
No doubt you've learned how to get through with your SS issues.
Hope things improve for you over the winter.
Thinking of you!

It's summer here.Ã¥Ã_ 37 degrees celcius today, ouch.Ã¥Ã_ Been having maximum temps late in the day.Ã¥Ã_ So much for going to the beach lol

Lotus1",5,1,413336567,6116,"I got to the doctor today and had a nasal culture for MRSA, got script for diflucan for the yeast, had blood work and doc checked my foot again. I have been putting up with it for 4 months as I thought it was inflammatory as I did not injure it in any way. Doc said today that it could be a ruptured tendon so off to the podiatrist I go. I just was so busy and put up with the pain. I can usually tough things out and I refused the podiatrist earlier this fall. Time will tell.

I had all normal blood work and the supposition is that all my tendons pains, weakness, muscle aches and all the other things bugging me are from the tapering off the prednisone. I am at 15 mgm every other day and am not cutting down anymore. Have infusion next week so will check with doc when I am up there. I need to feel better.

Called the contractor today and will get together with him about putting in new windows. These windows in the house are old and lots of cracks and event little holes in the glass., Have a little breeze when it is windy outside. It is downright chilly right now. Cold in MN!!! I am anxious to get the windows done this spring so I can slowly start painting the bedrooms. All the rooms have really dark pain and odd combination of colors. I think the lady who lived here (younger gal with 3 kids and hubby) had a dark spirit. The kitchen cupboards are painted white on the top, gray on the bottom ad the walls are tan. I don't get it at all. Maybe it was free paint.!!!

Have a good and warm weekend. Irish",2,4,53036569,6116,"Hi Irish,
I just popped in and see you moving. 
I can not imagine the adjustments you have been going through and continue to go through.
Besides the great wisdom you contribute regarding SJS you also bring great authenticity and heart to the journies of life. 
I pray for your health this morning and I pray for extra energies and a spirit of new adventure.
I am so glad you have sons and family to support you.

Oh the paint thing - those young ones paint so diversely. I am so boring, I only want different shades of light beige. Any other colors would cause me to be restless.

We have been in our home around 25 years and last year what started out as we need to repaint the the wood parts of our half brick home after buying the paint, we decided we don't ever want to paint again so we decided on steel siding and then I got the brain storm that we needed to add 8 ft to the bedroom end to accommodate our encreasing number of grands. Then new windows were brought into the project, renforced our front deck, retextured ceilings, new flooring, inlarged our bathroom and back bedrooms, created a walk through closet between them, knocked out a wall between dining room and living area, moved washer and dryer to the walk through closet and WOW that has proved to be handy. 

Anyway our small house was under construction while we lived in it. Our dog, Elroy would either hide or try to smash closely against me constantly with all the loud noises. I took him with me in the car on all the many reconstruction errands and then he would refuse to get out of the car when we returned home. This was all through Thanksgiving and Christmas time. Totally moved everything out of house first one end and then the other.

Our thinking was that the time was now, while we are able.
And as I read your journey I can't help but think of how much you have let go of and how courageous your heart is.
Please know you are in my prayers.
I don't show up here often, but when I do I search for you as you are the comforter in my sjoggy life, I have always appreciated your every WORD.
LOVE and HUGS, kimbo",5,1,73236573,6116,"Irish, I hope you get some relief with your foot and other issues. It is so difficult to think of all you have to get done when you are toughing out the physical problems and they add to the stress. Yes, in MN it sure does get cold. I hope you get those windows you need put in so you can be warmer. 

You are always in my prayers dear lady.
Hugs,
susanepÃ¥Ã_ :)",5,1,32336575,6116,"kimbo, I have to thank you for your post. I remember you and know that you haven't been on much lately. So many of the members will be on quite often and then drop out only to show up later on. It is great to hear from them and from you.

Oh, I can relate to your big remodeling project as hubby and I did that many years ago with the house I just left. We sided much of the house ourself and I can remember finishing one side of the house by mercury yard light cause rain was coming. So many hard things we did but we seemed to have a propensity for doing things ourselves and working together. Guess that is why I bought a house that needed some work. 

I am an eternal optimist because I plan to paint and do some things when I haqve the energy and strength. I am slow but hopefully I will perk up again after I get the boxes unpacked. Hard to totally relax when things aren't in their place.

The tidbit about your dog was so cute. I just see how your dog acted and looked and even thought about this whole situation. Dogs don't like change, do they. Thanks again for posting and your kind remarks. Take care. Irish",5,1,53036579,6116,"Hi Irish, 
I haven't been on the board for a few weeks so just saw your post.Ã¥Ã_ I think you have done an amazing amount of work in selling your house, moving somewhere temporarily, and then moving into your new house.Ã¥Ã_ And all of this in the midst of grieving for your wonderful hubbie. Great job!Ã¥Ã_ Hopefully you can slow down and put a lot of things on hold for a while while you regain some strength.Ã¥Ã_ Of course, the windows and restoring the walls to a somewhat normal color sound like things that will help you relax in your new surroundings.Ã¥Ã_ 

I just prayed for you and will continue to do so.

Becky",5,1,339136582,6116,"Irish....You amaze and inspire me. I've taken quite a long hiatus from these forums, as it just becomes overwhelming at times. I have to say though, every time I sign back on...no matter how long it has been....reading your posts always gives me hope and strength. You've been through so much, but somehow manage to ""just keep swimming,"" all the while finding the positive in all you can. Thank you for being you, Irish.

Julie",5,1,813036584,6116,"Wow, you have been through a lot of changes in the last couple of years, especially the last few months with two moves and the holidays! Sounds like you are handling it all well, and I'm sure your eternal optimism is one of the reasons. Your new home sounds like it is in a great location with your family as well as stores nearby. Grocery and prescription delivery - what a dream!

Now that all of your necessities are unpacked, you can take it easy with getting the rest of your belongings in place and settling in. A little at a time with rest in between. I hope your foot feels better soon. That would make everything easier. Have you figured out preferences for paint colors yet? I bet it will be a big relief to get the windows done. It's so cold in MN, let alone having leaky windows.

Best wishes for much happiness in your new home.",5,1,48136585,6116,"Thinking of you, Irish, as you make these transitions--without your beloved hubby.

I know what you mean about the dark paint colors in the rooms.Ã¥Ã_ I know of a few people who like the dark colors.Ã¥Ã_ Myself, I like the light, sunshiny colors.Ã¥Ã_ Our kitchen is a light yellow, and our laundry room is a little darker yellow.Ã¥Ã_ Yellow makes me feel happy.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_:D 

We have one bedroom in our house that only has primer on the walls and has never been painted.Ã¥Ã_ Still can't decide on a color for this room.Ã¥Ã_ What's the hurry, we've lived here for the last 24 years!!Ã¥Ã_ :o hehe

With time, everything will fall into place.Ã¥Ã_ A little here, a little there.Ã¥Ã_ Irish, I'm younger than you and I still have a few boxes sitting around from a couple years back.Ã¥Ã_ I just walk around them - I'll get to them ""some day""!Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_;)

Could you hire a ""helper"" to come help with some little projects around the house?Ã¥Ã_ I know you've said you are independent . . . but . . . you could get a few projects done with a little help.Ã¥Ã_ Maybe a local high school has a co-op class that could do some service work for their class and help you at the same time.Ã¥Ã_ If you lived closer to me, heck, I'd come help for free just to have a chance to visit with you and enjoy all your life's wisdom.

With your drafty windows, maybe you could get that plastic stuff that shrink wraps around your windows by using a blow dryer.Ã¥Ã_ That might help until you get the windows replaced in the spring.

I hope your foot feels better - you better quit putting it off and go get it looked at.Ã¥Ã_ Please.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_;)

Bucky",5,1,143536612,6131,"Hey all, 
Ã¥Ã_I just seen my Rheum. and we are discussing changing my med from Hydroxychloriquine (plaquenil) to either Methotrexate or Azathioprine. I am wondering what kind of side effects and how you reacted to them? I have done some looking online but would like first hand experience on the meds. 

Thank you all
Sarah",1,5,813636613,6131,"Hi Sarah,

I've been on Methotrexate for two months now.Ã¥Ã_ The only immediate side effect I noticed was very soft bowel motions the morning after I took it.Ã¥Ã_ This settled over a three week period.Ã¥Ã_ I also had a few migraines at the end of December, normally I don't get migraines very often, whether this was related to the Methotrexate or coincidence I don't know.

I take this in the evening and also take Folic acid (as advised on this site).Ã¥Ã_ For me this has been a wonder drug.Ã¥Ã_ I was too busy looking for side effects to notice exactly when I started to feel better, but by the fifth day I was telling all and sundry how great it was.Ã¥Ã_ 

I did initially find it seemed to wear off by the sixth day but after six week this had evened out.

Hope you find something that works well for you.
Sarah",4,5,391636614,6131,"hello muphin83

I have been on Plaquenil and methotrexate for over 5 years now.

In the beginning I had an upset stomach and headache the morning after 

I took my dose. After about 2 months it stopped.

Once I had to quit taking the methotrexate b/c my gyno gave me Bactrim

to treat a UTI and it caused my WBC to drop. My rheumy said of all the

antibiotics NOT to take with methotrexate.........do not take Bactrim.


I am surprised your dr. is taking you off Plaquenil and just giving you the

methotrexate/or azathioprine. I was told by my rheumy that taking meds in

combination together they work much better.Ã¥Ã_ Plaquenil alone just wasn't enough

after he took me off the prednisone and he added the methotrexate.



good luck with which-ever you take.


shelly",3,5,178536616,6131,"I started methotrexate last year and for me it was as though a switch on symptoms had been turned to 'off'. 
Dr. had me doing labs every week for about 8 weeks. Then less often. 
Methotrexate was increased. 
At a point around August I felt unwell and liver labs were off... I have been on a month off methotrexate and will be starting again soon at lower dose. 
Not sure liver labs were connected to Methtorexate.. other tests were done for Hepatistis etc. (Negative)
So while off Methotrexate I got flu vaccine, etc. Dr. protocol is off Methx for 2weeks then vaccine, wait 2 weeks: restart. 

The only side effect effect I had was that my skin was more photosensitive to sunlight .. and had some low blistering along back during the summer. Dr. increased plaquinel as he stated it has protective qualities. And that if I were to vacation near equator he would increase just prior to a trip. 

Overall I found that my ability to be productive went from 40 to 80%, with marked increase in mental clarity.",1,5,34136617,6131,"I have never been on Methotrexate so I have no experience with it. I cannot take it due to past medical history.

However, I was on Imuran (Azanthioprine) for a month. I got pretty sick on it with explosive diarrhea, feeling unwell and tired, and nausea and projectile vomiting. My liver enzymes skyrocketed. So, after a month, I stopped it. 

I think it is just a matter of trial and error to try to find the drug that will work for you and that you can tolerate in terms of side effects. You may have no side effects or only minor ones or you may not tolerate the drugs. My cousin who has RA has been on Methotrexate for years and tolerates it just fine. She has tried various drugs (as a second drug) and some she tolerates and others she does not. Some work, some don't. It is trial and error. 

Hopefully your doctor will run a bunch of screening tests to be sure that you do not have any diseases or viruses that can be activated while on these immune suppressants. Mine ran Hepatitis panel, TB blood test, and some other tests prior to starting the drugs. You also need frequent lab monitoring while on the drugs. 

For Azantioprine, you need a special genetic test done prior to starting the drug. If you lack a certain genetic component you cannot take the drug as you will be at high risk for a sever complication. I will see if I can find that test name.

You should have all vaccines current before starting the drugs. If you have never had a Shingles vaccine, you should get one prior to starting the drugs. The vaccine is about 60% effective in preventing Shingles, but 60% is better than nothing. The vaccine is also thought to decrease the severity of any outbreak. 

While on the drugs, be very alert for Shingles (Herpes) outbreak. If you getÃ¥Ã_ Shingles, you must seek care ASAP (same day if possible) and get on anti viral treatment for it. If you delay treatment of Shingles, you risk getting post-herpetic neuralgia and that can be a life long extremely painful problem. ( did get Shingles while on Prednisone and while on Cellcept, but I recognized the Shingles right away, got treatment, and cleared it up with no residual.)

Here is the genetic test:

""TPMT Testing: It is recommended that consideration be given to either genotype or phenotype patients for TPMT. Phenotyping and genotyping methods are commercially available. The most common non-functional alleles associated with reduced levels of TPMT activity are TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C. Patients with two non-functional alleles (homozygous) have low or absent TPMT activity and those with one non-functional allele (heterozygous) have intermediate activity. Accurate phenotyping (red blood cell TPMT activity) results are not possible in patients who have received recent blood transfusions. TPMT testing may also be considered in patients with abnormal CBC results that do not respond to dose reduction. Early drug discontinuation in these patients is advisable. TPMT TESTING CANNOT SUBSTITUTE FOR COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT (CBC) MONITORING IN PATIENTS RECEIVING Azathioprine. ""

In early 2015 I started having pain & tenderness on the left side of my throat. A doctor had a quick feel but couldn?t feel anything so I didn?t bother asking about it again. And I thought it may have been my Fibromyalgia starting to affect my throat. 

Then in the second half of 2015, a lot of other symptoms started creeping up on me and getting more severe & more frequent. Like tremors (mostly in head & neck), palpitations, pressure in my chest, pressure against my throat, shortness of breath, vibration/tingling in upper body, headaches & sinus pressure, stiff neck on left side, problems with body awareness, dizziness, nausea, dry eyes, dry mouth, a funny taste in my mouth & a tingling tongue. 

I recently started to think I may have Dysautonomia (dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system). I?ve visited the Emergency Dept and my GP so many times over the past few months and had blood tests, chest x-rays, brain CT scan, Holter monitor, Echocardiogram but nothing serious was found (although they think I may have a small hole in the heart so I've been referred to a cardiologist). Doctors told me I probably just have Anxiety & that I may need counselling & medication. 

Then 2 weeks ago I got diagnosed with a swollen salivary gland on the left side of my throat, and my GP put me on a 5 day course of antibiotics. But the gland is still swollen. I?ve been googling symptoms and came across Sjogren?s & it seems to fit. 

I?d noticed that I was getting dry in the mouth a lot, dry skin & hands (fingers sometimes look like prunes even when I haven?t had them in water), but I just put it down to aging & a side-effect of pills I?m on. I?ve also got a kidney transplant and I wonder about having an autoimmune disease & taking immune suppressing drugs at the same time?

I?m not sure how soon I?ll be able to get tested for Sjogren?s. If the doctor doesn?t think of Sjogren?s as a possibility, I may have to suggest it. I live in a town of 11,000 but I think it?d be better to get all this sorted at the city hospital where I had my transplant (175 miles away). And they?ll be able to refer me to any specialists at their hospital. My symptoms have become severe over the past few months so I hope there?s some kind of treatment to reverse or slow this down. I live on my own & life?s a struggle as it is.",1,5,815436698,6143,"Welcome to our forum. While I do not want to stress you out further, it often takes 7 years to get a Sjogrens diagnosis.

In fact I went in with the moth on my face and ended up with a dx of sjogrens based on symptoms alone.

if you want to get a head start on management....
Sip, swish, and swallow your water

i have been diagnosed with severe dry eyes from 20 yrs of excessive computer use
""computer vision"" infrequent, inadequate blinking. (nov. 2015).
and i've also recently been diagnosed with Sjogrens (dec. 2015)
i don't know what's affecting my eyes more, the severe dry eye or Sjogrens.
i have some dry mouth - mostly early mornings only.

Questions to this group:
1. i seem to need 7 to 8 vials of Bion tears in a 12 hour period (more if i am on the computer for 6 hrs. is it normal to go through so many vialsÃ¥Ã_ for you all? can you buy it in bulk?
2. Ophthalmologist wants me to go on Restasis with steroid. I am hesitant to do this. I'm worried about it not being helpful and possibly harmful. 
3. Has anyone tried the Lipiflow procedure or manual meibomian gland expression (and if so what was the cost)? really want to know more about this.
4. I can cry when I'm sad/overwhelmed, do other people with Sjogrens still generate emotional tears?

i have changed my diet and habits 
(+) taking Bion tears every half hour while awake (really feels healing)
(+) taking Genteal severe dry eye gel at bedtime
(-) Refresh plus (for daytime) irritated my eyes
(-) eye drops with preservatives (ie. Blink, Sustane) irritated my eyes
(+) 80%=organic steamed greens, 10%= whole grains
(+) taking fish oil & flax oil 3 times a day
(+)doing blinking exercises
(+) taking frequent closed eyes breaks
(+) using Ocusoft eyelid scrub 2 times a day
(+) wash face with baby shampoo 2x a day
(+) using Biotene toothpaste & mouth spray 2x a day

Sigh",1,3,122837109,6178,"Nephritis in Sjogren's Syndrome Responds to MMF

""Patients with primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS)-related tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) present with significant renal impairment and frequent other tubular defects, according to summary of 12 cases with TIN secondary to pSS, British researchers reported.

Writing in BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders, the authors, led by Rhys D.R. Evans of University College London, described the demographic, biochemical, immunological and histological characteristics of 12 patients (11 female) with TIN secondary to pSS, and their response to immunosuppression.

Evans and colleagues found that treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) appeared to improve renal function in the majority of patients.

The tubular lesion of pSS is characterized by a mononuclear lymphocytic infiltrate that is predominantly composed of CD4+ T-cells. Epithelial inflammation that occurs with pSS leads to renal disease in as many as 42% of patients with pSS. The most common renal lesion in pSS is TIN.

All patients underwent investigation with serum biochemistry, immunology, and renal biopsy. Nine of the 12 also had urinary acidification testing performed. At presentation, the patients had moderate renal impairment, with a median serum creatinine of 133 Ã«_mol/L, but little or no hypokalemia.

Overall, 75% of patients had evidence of abnormal urinary acidification. Of the nine patients who had urinary acidification testing, seven had abnormal urinary acidification, indicating distal renal tubular acidosis (median baseline urine pH 6.24, median nadir urine pH 5.77) and one had an equivocal result.

Proximal tubular dysfunction was assessed in eight patients by measuring urinary retinol binding protein (RBP). The urinary RBP/creatinine ratio was abnormally high in five patients, with a median of 102 Ã«_g/mmol (normal range 4-32 Ã«_g/mmol), and two others had extremely high ratios (as high as 5885 Ã«_g/mmol).

All patients underwent a renal biopsy, and in all, histology revealed a tubulointerstitial nephritis. Eleven patients had renal tissue to review. The inflammatory cell infiltrate was diffuse in two of the biopsies and patchy in the remainder, and the intensity was rated as 1+ (light) in five, 2+ (moderate) in five, and 3+ (heavy) in one. The proportion of interstitium affected by the infiltrate was <25 % in three, 25% to 50 % in two, 50% to 75% in two, and >75 % in four. In all cases the predominant cell type was mononuclear lymphocytes. Scarring was judged to be light in six patients, moderate in four, and heavy in one.

""The patients in this series were all treated with MMF; the rationale being that MMF would affect both T-cell and B-cell populations and should therefore be effective across the spectrum of pSS TIN,"" the investigators wrote. ""Indeed, MMF has been used successfully with acute TIN in other settings.""

The dose of MMF was titrated according to symptoms and recovery of renal function. In patients with hypergammaglobulinemia, the dose was titrated to the immune globulin G (IgG) level within the normal range.

Treatment with MMF with or without a course of oral corticosteroids improved excretory renal function. The median serum creatinine decreased significantly from 153 Ã«_mol/L to 124 Ã«_mol/L (P=0.02) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) improved from 32 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 42 mL/min/1.73 m2 (P=0.04). The GFR also improved following treatment, from 37 mL/min/1.73 m2 to 46 mL/min/ 1.73 m2 (P=0.04) in the six patients in whom it was measured directly. Serum IgG levels decreased significantly following treatment (20.1 g/L to 17.3 g/L, P=0.01).

The authors note that their series is the first of patients with pSS TIN alone to demonstrate a significant improvement in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-derived estimated GFR with MMF treatment. ""That the measured 51Cr-GFR in six of these patients significantly improved suggests that this effect is real,"" they wrote.

Since the study was a retrospective description of patients from a single institution, a limitation is that investigations and treatment regimens were not completely uniform, and the results may not be generalizable to all patients with pSS.""

Many thanks",1,4,824037131,6185,"Sounds painful, I hope you can figure it out!Ã¥Ã_ Sorry, I'm not much help.",4,1,809337133,6185,"I had several months of hot, red, burning skin on my calves bilaterally in 2013. It felt and looked like a very bad sunburn, but it was not a sunburn. I also had lower leg, ankle, and feet edema. My GP could not figure it out either. I had the redness and burning for about 8 months and the edema for about 5.5 months. I started taking high quality bio-curcumin 400 mg twice a day (life Extensions brand) and after about a month it cleared up. In retrospect, I now know I was in an Auto-immune flare but, at that time, I was not even diagnosed with Sjogren's, so I had no clue what was going on. The redness and burning have not come back, but I do get lower leg, ankle, and feet edema every time I go into a flare. I still take the Curcumin, 400 mg twice a day. 

If you have a Rheumatologist, I would make an appt. with him/her. It could be some sort of vasculitis or it may be some sort of blood component disorder (related to Sjogren's or not related to Sjogren's).

I saw in one of your prior posts that your doctor said plaquenil is an old drug with toxicity issues. Both are true, but toxicity is rare and can be caught early by monitoring with eye exams. Have you decided not to take it or has your doctor refused to prescribe it? Has your doctor offered an alternative?

It helps with the pain, aching, fatigue and just different things for lots of people. It is an old drug but still a very good drug. It is an anti-parasitic drug that has been used for years to cure malaria. It is also given in much higher dosages for the malaria and that is when people have to have their eyes checked a lot for toxicity.

Many of the doctors have no clue about Plaquenil and they scare patients to death. We take much lower dosages and should have an eye exam done before we start the med and then every 6-12 months while on it. Lots of us(including me) think that the drug isn't doing much for us until we decide to quit the drug cause we think it is useless. In about 2-3 weeks we start having a lot of symptoms that return and we find out just how good that drug really is.

It sound like you need a doctor who is more helpful. Do you have a good primary care doctor? If you are having problems getting helpful support and information then maybe you need to look into getting a second opinion. Sjogrens isn't the end of the world. We can feel crappy as heck and then have a few good days and sometimes a lot of good days.

How we feel is determined on our medical care, having our symptoms treated and thinking positively. Keep reading the info on this site and you will find out a lot of information that will help you. You will also find out that we all have our good and bad days but that living life is still possible. Also, you need to know that depression and anxiety are extremely common in people with autoimmune diseases and especially in Sjogrens. You need to let your doctor know how you are feeling emotionally as an antidepressant can really help you cope with your illness. Not only that, antidepressants help diminish the aches and pains some and change some of the symptoms for the better. Antidepressants can have a drying affect, but if you start at a low dose and don't panic you should be able to cope.

There is a product called Oral Balance that makes a gel in a tube that works great. Just squirt a little in your mouth and swish it some and when you swallow it coats your throat also. Make sure to see an eye doctor and get checked for dryness. Many of us have used the eye drop Restasis for years to help diminish the dryness in the eyes. It truly does work. It will burn at first. The eye doc should give you steroid (cortisone) eye drops for a week or so to settle down the inflammation prior to starting the Restasis. The Restasis is used 2 times a day and we can use the little plastic vial for 2 days or 4 doses to save money. Just place the plastic vial in a little plastic container on a was of cotton or Kleenex in an upright position so the tip of the vial doesn't touch anything. You can also refrigerate the drops and they will feel cool and not burn as much.

The burning is because your eyes are sore and inflamed. The longer you use the REstasis the more healing takes place and the burning will go away. Know that we all understand on this site and will give you support. Take care now. There is hope but you have to seek out more information to make you in control. Right now your illness is controlling you and that isn't a good feeling. Irish",5,5,53037209,6196,"Just wondering how long have you had sjogrens.

Without medications, I would have been unable to continue working from about the beginning of October last year (possibly a couple of months earlier, as lower doses of medication were moderating the pain somewhat). Since starting on Lyrica, I've had greatly improved sleep and can get to sleep at a reasonable hour, and as a result greatly improved energy. The echoing bell-like pain bouncing along my bones also stopped. The Celebrex has stopped the tendon pain and muscle fatigue that had been with me since I was 15. The Primolut has eliminated the interaction between hormonal and inflammatory issues, removing the ache in the lower back/sacro-illiac joints/hips that meant for about 2 weeks out of 4 walking was a painful struggle, and allowing that to finally heal so I can walk without pain (and now I can do an 8-10km walk without any issues). My biggest issue to get under control has been the nerve pain in my hands - the last 7-8 months has been a race between the progression of pain and whether the medications could deal with it well enough to allow me to continue to use my hands for normal, everyday tasks. At the moment they've been stable for the last 4 weeks (for the first time since it started!), but it's taken max dose of Lyrica + near max dose of Tramadol + 60mg of Duloxetine (+ possibly the Plaquenil) to get there. The worst point for my hands was at the beginning of October - by the time I saw my GP they had reached the point where I couldn't open cupboards/doors/fridges, drive, hold a glass of liquid in my fingers, use a knife and fork, etc...now I've got usage for most normal activities, but I still cannot hold a computer mouse without the palms becoming firey and my fingertips feeling bruised/abraded.

So for me, medications have given me space to have a life in - for the first time in my adult life. When I think about what I've gained, I'm almost euphoric - it's been life-changing.

Maybe it's a part of a major flare or maybe it's because the cold spell over Finland (here in the south almost -30C/-22F, in the north about -40C/-40F) - that makes the air very dry, too. Yesterday I must've applied eye drops about 10 times and still my eyes were itchy, burning and stinging.

The dr said my eyes are ok, nothing serious, just very, very dry. She suggested I try melting plugs to see if they help me. Well, she managed to get one in, the other fell on the table (because she had clumsy tweezers she saidÃ¥Ã_ ;D ). The table was desinfied etc but she told me I could decide if she'll try to put it in, too. I found it really weird but thought ok. However, this time she dropped it on the floorÃ¥Ã_ ::) I didn't ask if the pair of plugs was the last one or what, but now she said that I can now compare with the other eye if the plug helps or not! I found this very, very odd... Not to mention embarrassing!

Why do I always come up with these weird doctors...?!

With this ordeal it's good to know that if I opt for the permanent plugs, they don't do that here but I have to go to the next big cityÃ¥Ã_ ;D 

Anyway, now I'm feeling some very mild intermittent pain in that eye with the plug and that side's temple. Is that normal?

I actually had to go about a week with only one disolvable plug, because one tear duct was very small and she had to order them. Mine has great humor.

Well everyday something came up and I just forgot to go and after a week I realized the itching was gone!
Keep an eye on it, no pun intended, and if you must then go back and have it looked at just to make sure,nothing is infected.

Yes, Shirmer's test assesses amount of tears. The tear break up time (TBUT) test assesses tear evaporation time.

If you find the plugs a benefit for your eyes, you may want to have your

lower tear ducts closed for good. You never have to experience any of them

I could have permanent ones or have my lower tear ducts cauterized shut.

I believe that if you have green that indicates bacteria, however what ever is coming out of your nose may not not be the same as what is lodged in your sinuses. My allergist gave me a protocol that has helped me. It is to be done at the first sign of infection so maybe for next time for you.

SAN...

Saline rinse (I use neti pot as I think that works better than spray)
Afrin
Nasal steroid

I also use my neti once or twice daily as a preventative. I have only had a couple os infections in over five years since doing this regularly. Now, I also do not have the immune deficiency so that is of course a big factor. Also, you may not be able to use a nasal steroid with your yeast problem.

Yes! This was my very 1st symptom! It's been driving me crazy for about a year now trying to
figure this out, especially since it mostly happens to me only on one side and worsens as the day goes on.
I've been to 8 eye doctors trying to get an answer, and NO doctor has been able to be of any help.
I've been sent to eye and brain CT, testing for MG, allergists, plastic eye surgeons... you name it. ::)

What I have been able to figure out after all this time (on my own since doctors have proven useless) is that what happens beneath the brow is a similar process to the swelling I get in my salivary glands at times.
Beneath the brow is where the lacrimal gland that produces tears is located. Since we have problems with moisture flow from specifically these glands (as well as from salivary glands), there can be a build-up of fluids in these areas which don't move along as they should. This may simulate the appearance of ptosis or MG since it causes a general drooping, putting pressure on nerves and on other areas of the eyelid.

The solution? Well, that's a tricky one that I'm still working on.
What I've come up with so far:
1- Salagen/Evoxac might help if they produce more tears for you, thereby moving things along in that area (I can't take Salagen and can't yet get my hands on any Evoxac so I can't test this theory for myself).
2- Warming the area underneath the eyebrow with a microwaved eye mask for a few minutes and then massaging that entire area, trying to manually help the fluids drain.
3- Yawning continuously aids in tear flow.
3- Crying... :'( (it actually does the trick quite well!)Ã¥Ã_

Joe, no, I didn't get a flipper because these are both back bottom molars that no one can see. Good luck on your extraction Tuesday. Will be thinking of you and please let us know how it goes and how you are doing afterward.

Quietdynamics, that sounds like an awful ordeal. Why is it that we don't treat ourselves with the same compassion we would someone else? I am getting better at doing this though. It is just that all of the things that need to be done get on my nerves. But I am also getting better at just ignoring them and knowing they will be better done when I am feeling better with more energy. And if I force myself do them when not feeling well, they will take twice the time, will not get done well, and that will set me back even more. I have had the same situation where I had a very bad reaction to an antibiotic days after I stopped. For me it was the cephalosporins (Keflex, Omnicef). Hives all over my body and then legs swelled to twice their size and skin peeled off of them. What antibiotic caused you problems and what was your reaction?Ã¥Ã_ I am on a week of penicillin VK for the infection but it hasn't caused problems previously. Fingers crossed. Hate having to take antibiotics, but they are a Godsend when we need them, right?

Eija, I understand about a simply cavity fix wiping you out. I have to take a mild sedative before any dental procedure, too. I took one before this, and I was so thankful I had taken it when I heard the cracking, the tooth had to come out in pieces, and the oral surgeon had to get out the big drill, scrape up the bone to accept the graft. (Ugh!) Thanks for relaying that the injection site often gives more pain than the actual problem spot for you too. I wonder if that has to do with our Sjogren's - the inflammation thing. My cheek is all swollen down where the injections were given. I am finding that putting lotion on it and massaging it is helping break up the hardness and swelling a little - in case that might help you in the future.

Carolina, thanks for your advice - yes you are right about the inflammation. And thanks for sharing that you are phobic about dental work too. I guess that is pretty common. I sure hope you are feeling better today after your IVIG/IgG. Did you call your immunologist.

AI diseases take enough of a toll on our bodies. Add in a covert tooth infection and it's a trigger source of flare. I know I felt better after having 4 extractions in 2012. The antibiotic post op helped as well. ;)

I have no experience with MTX.

Ã¥Ã_However, on the extraction - that is considered an invasive procedure. Do follow your aftercare instructions vigilantly regarding the extraction site. Any sign of problems, call your oral surgeon's office. I've had to go back after an extraction (especially molars) as a piece of tooth or bone would work it's way up. When the tooth breaks during extraction, sometimes they think they got it all and a tiny piece gets missed. 

Do what you're doing as far as resting as you need to.",2,5,92037534,6231,"Quote from: LucyD on June 08, 2014, 07:37:10 AMMy cheek is all swollen down where the injections were given. 

I just wonder if it's possible that the needle goes all the way to the parotid gland. Because that's how it sometimes feels like, when the dentist sticks it into the back of my jaw. It causes some pain/discomfort in my ear. So, if the needle reaches the parotid, I think it's only normal to have discomfort there the next day.

QuoteGiving myself my third MTX injection this afternoon - a little nervous but it will be old hat soon.
During both my pregnancies I had to take injections of blood thinner every day from the week 24 until 6 weeks after birth, because I had a DVT when I was 27 or 28. And always in context of surgery I have to get those injections again. I'm afraid of needles and never managed to give them to myself - so my husband has given them to me. However, this time around (again after the gallbladder surgery I'm on them for ten days) I somehow managed to actually do it myself! It was horrible and scary and nasty, but I did it! The next day it was equally horrible and scary and nasty, but I did it again. And again. I hate it. I hate the injections. But I can manage them by myself now. Even if barely.",1,5,141937537,6231,"Thanks for the advice Amanda - pampered myself this past weekend, but back at work now and boy it is stressful and busy. Whoa!

I have read about that - that pieces of tooth missed and bone can work their way out if it breaks during extraction. Have been watching for that. I think I am also still trying to get over a virus/cold that has lingered for about 6 weeks now and it is getting ""old."" The tooth infection and extraction was probably the blow I didn't need.

Eija - congratulations to you for mastering your blood thinner injections. Do you get to use a small needle/syringe like an insulin or tuberculin syringe? That is what I use. I have done three now and they are getting less formidable. Or as you said, ""horrible, scary and nasty"".Ã¥Ã_ :) ;) ;D
Very interesting thought about lidocaine injections going into parotid gland.

I know this is old but i found it very helpful! I had a tooth pulled last week and fortunately the tooth area pain hasn't been that bad and the procedure went well it seemed. I was really worried before and had put it off for months....but the part that is really putting me down for the count is this incredible fatigue I am experiencing this week--I took a LOA so could have space to recover as had a bad experience with this last year.Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_But I am curious about this exhaustion....what the mechanism is behind it, what it did to immune system or other aspects of me to make me need to rest so much more than usual.Ã¥Ã_ I am glad for the tooth to be out though and hoping in the long run will feel better as it caused me a lot of pain all year....and I am suspecting maybe longer it has been a component to some pain flares I got. I think teeth play into neurogenic burning pain flares and perhaps the healthier they are or not there if unhealthy the better, one less trigger for burning central nerve pain.

NOw I just need to see how my cervical spine recovers from the trauma, it is irritated from it and am considering getting a steroid injection (would be my first time) to help relieve some of the pressure from stenosis. I did suspect all the lidocaine helped minimize initial neck pain, but as it wore off it has been bothering me.

Like FAD, I can only share my experience with you. I do much better on brand than generic. To be honest, it is always hard for me to sort out which symptom is caused by which thing.

I have co-morbid conditions that both cause some of the same symptomology, along with meds that can have some of those same symptoms. Because I noticed a very quick positive response to the Plaquenil, I chose to continue the drug. 

Like all of us..my symptoms wax, wane & flare..but most are manageable..enough that I would not discontinue the Plaquenil.

I agree with sunshine, get back with oral surgeon about that taste in your mouth. This far after your extraction, I wonder if the extraction site properly closed.

As for your neck pain flaring from the extraction, that is always a problem for me even for dental cleaning. I bring my own neck support for every dental visit, usually a good thick bath hand towel that I can roll up under my neck. Doesn't prevent neck pain afterwards but it does minimize the severity of pain.

As for injections for your neck pain, I get them frequently (about every 6 months). Usually it is a combination of anesthesia (such as marcaine or bupivicaine) and and small amount of kenalog (steroid). They are uncomfortable, but sure do help to break the pain cycle. After a dental visit, I usually need what is called trigger point injections which are into the muscles. Sometimes, I get nerve blocks if occipital neuralgia kicks up a storm.",1,5,92037549,6231,"litliwlowa--I have call into doctor to get more information about what kind of injection she was talking about

All very good questions, wendyoh

okay, there is no ibuprofen in the trigger point or nerve blocks I have received into my neck region. 

Location of injection depends on where the pain trigger is. For an example, the back of the neck, those muscles specifically, I have had as any as 5 injections into the neck muscles themselves to include left trapezius (the latter around shoulder blades). Pain related to cervical radiculopathy, as well as squeezing headaches.

Nerve blocks, such as what I received yesterday into greater occipital nerve bilaterally (both sides), near base of skull either side of neck. For occipital neuralgia.

Do they help? OH YES.

How do they feel? Uncomfortable, not going to lie to you about that. 

What I generally do is straddle the chair, let upper part of chest hang over back of chair and arms loose. Then I tap my right foot for distraction, in such a way that my body isn't moving. This time, PMP did give me a small dose of valium first to relax my muscles before proceeding with nerve block.

Kenalog is not an NSAID, it is a steroid. Now yesterday I was not given steroid with injection, as I am currently on yet again a prednisone taper.

Trigger point injections - sometimes they burn a little and if the muscle region is particularly taught, yes it will hurt, like a bee sting.

Oh I also default to the deep breathing of Lamaz to help me relax for these procedures and again distract myself from the procedures.

But the relief after it kicks in is well worth it. 

Trigger point injections: once I am at the point of needing them, >10 pain on scale relentlessly. Pain med offers nominal relief. When that persists for me more than 1-2 weeks, I need trigger point injections. That basically brings me back to my baseline pain level of about 5, and with pain med less often.

Nerve block: up until yesterday's nerve blocks, even on prednisone taper AND pain meds, over a week at crippling 10+ pain that pain med didn't even touch. Pain interrupted sleep, BP was wonky high etc.

Today, no not pain free, but at least I can move around without feeling like someone jammed my skull on my neck, pain is well controlled with pain med again, BP purring like a kitten and I don't have that excruciating nerve pain.

Your doc determines one or the other would be helpful for you. I encourage you to consider your doc's recommendation.

Also, from what you describe of your neck situation, how long as it been since your c-spine was MRI'd? I ask as the situation in your neck may have changed, and perhaps a round of physical therapy may be in order. LOW level PT. I am on home traction (Saunders device, not the water bag over the door type) for multilevel bluging discs throughout c-spine with some effacment on the cord, etc.",1,5,92037559,6231,"Wow.Ã¥Ã_ I had a tooth extracted about six years ago.Ã¥Ã_ I had to go back four times to keep having parts of it removed.Ã¥Ã_ I remember the oral surgeon was mad because there was this big abcess in the root section.Ã¥Ã_ I was only diagosed with Sjogrens last year, but now I am putting things together.Ã¥Ã_ Hang in there.Ã¥Ã_ You are not alone.Ã¥Ã_ I was soooooo tired.",3,4,142037561,6231,"wow Judie, that sounds frustrating, I can't blame complications so far like you had, just exhausted from the one incident, I think he got it all that day in 3 pieces because the actual tooth isn't hurting, but this incredible exhaustion sort of like when I had mono or really flare up CFS stuff with like work involved w/moving residences--maybe you will get better now its out
I am going to see my surgeon on Monday if things get worse over weekend but that bad taste part is going away (I put clove oil near mygum maybe that helped) and there isn't pain in the socket, seems like its not infected, but maybe the bacteria went into my blood stream when he pulled it causing aftermath tiredness....I don't know the immune mechanisms that explain this fatigue after surgery. Maybe it lowers natural killer cells or something but I don' know why.

Well Ms. Flower thank you so much for the injection detail. I am dying to know which one they are thinking would help shrink neural tissue for cervical stenosis, would going in the muscle I wonder effect a crowded spinal canal to help it shrink? Because its notÃ¥Ã_ my muscles that hurt a lot per se I dont think, but it probably deals with all of it some I assume because I know you have a variety of things dysfunctioning in yr spine.

I last had an MRI summer of 2014 so yea, hmm, maybe they would, I hate mri's, they didnt use to bother me but the older I get the more laying on the table bothers me and I swear last time i felt like it slightly moved the staples at old gallbladder scar area from 89, I never thought it bothered them when i used to get regular mris like 15 years ago. Maybe they are stronger now. anyway I digress.

I like how you said ""I'm not gonna lie"" lol but it sounds much better obviously than contemplating a laminectomy/fusion or something.
I am really sorry for your level of pain, I cannot say mine is that severe most of the time if ever, there are days where I wish i could disappear for sure and the chronic recurrng nature has worn me down but its just relative to what i know....right now what is bothering me more than actual stabbing or stinging which thankfully isn't as bad as last extraction, but its more the feeling of strangulation from the stenosis getting irritated which makes me feel more SOB and spacey and irritable....I just want to lie in bed all day when its like this.",1,5,503337563,6231,"also litliwlowa I was thinking of ketoprofen that I had in my topical cream not kenalog, whoops",1,4,503337565,6231,"wendyoh

Have you looked into Penetrex as a topical anti-inflammatory? It is not a NSAID. Amazon carries it. Of course check with your doctor on that as an alternative.

As for your spinal stenosis, yeah got that too. Ask more detail from your doctor recommending the injections. You would be surprised perhaps at how the nerve roots affect the muscles relative to neck pain. 

I was wondering also, when you had the extraction, were you under general or local anesthesia? Sounds like maybe general and I know from experience that unless we speak up with dentist or oral surgeon, they are going to position us in the chair for their comfort and convenience. And that doesn't work for spinal stenosis.

It was actually the combination of a nasty fall and extractions (mine shattered during extractions) that triggered occipital neuralgia in the first place for me.",1,5,92037567,6231,"litliwlowa--thanks for info, I will be googling penetrex
Stenosis bites

so a year+ ago I had my first extraction (since teen with wisdom many moons ago) and did do general anesthesia at docs rec against my better judgement and that led to a bad year this last year but motivated me to investigate other self care things like injection may get now
and yep, the surgeon puts you in position he likes which isÃ¥Ã_ not good for neck as you say

So this time I only did local and it didn't hurtÃ¥Ã_ my neck as bad as last time because I held my neck in safer position but still hurt it, I think even just the wiggling of tooth to get it out, moving head like that, irritates spine, they even had assistant hold my head so it could have been worse, but it was the sense that the lidocaine numbed me from neck up for couple days, he put so much in me,and I am a very slow detoxer, that made me realize perhaps more lidocaine and the steroid specifically for my neck might be a really good thing to try

this is an aside, but I also wore my neck collar during procedure, which I don't do very often, while it helps with the mild instabilty I can have it seems to push my neck into a position that can irritate things in other ways---especially lying down, it seems like the back of the collar gets pushed into my neck from lying in the chair and that sort of causes flexion or something that irritates the stenosis.Ã¥Ã_ Are you aware of any other protective measure when at dentist to hold neck in place that wouldnt have that extra too much stuff pushing in on the neck? sometimes I have just rolled up like a down vest and put it under head and then held it still and maybe that would work with also having a dental assistant hold head in place....just thinking of what to do for next time, as I imagine there will sooner or later be a next time......

I am really sorry to hear about how you got occipital neuralgia and that you have it....when I had that extraction a year ago it dawned on me that dental issues as i age are going to be one of the biggest challenges to ageing and pain as I go forward

Interesting about the neck collar. I used to have one, but noticed it so restricted my movement (such as when driving, or reading or even light housekeeping) I was taking it off more than putting it on. Eventually I tossed it. Mine was just the basic one. Caused more problems pain wise than it alleviated.

What I find best that works for me at dentist, and it isn't foolproof by any means, I have a thick hand towel that I roll up and place under my neck. Thick enough to support the neck and accommodate positioning by dentist. Oh and my dentist knows NOT to put that chair so low as for some odd reason that position obstructs my breathing. We also establish a hand signal if I need to have a stretch break.

Since I already know from experience positioning in that dern chair invariably is going to flare my neck big time, I take a klonipin an hour before dentist appt, and pain med on arrival. My pain med doesn't make me drousy and doesn't kick in until I get home.

Then when I get home, right away I start with moist heat on neck. 20 mins on 20 mins off, plus lay on heating pad length of entire back. Light stretches in between (from physical therapist a while back). I also have to mess with TM joints as they get really tight.

Good luck to you and hugs, I know the sadness and frustration that this brings.",4,4,122837625,6247,"Thanks for sharing your experiences girls,
it really is frustrating, especially since Plaquenil is my last hope
for trying to slow down disease progression.
No rheumy will prescribe me anything else since my symptoms aren't ""systemic""
and since they claim other meds have even worse side effects I won't be abe to tolerate 
due to my sensitivities.Ã¥Ã_ :(",2,4,160637628,6247,"HiÃ¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_:)

When I started Plaquenil I was told, by my rheumy, to get onto it slowly over the course of a month or more. I was told to break the 100mg pill into two and to take one half every second day for the first week. Was told always to take after food. Built up week by week after that - a half pill at a time till I was eventually on 200mg per day. I was on that for 3 months before using the same method to build up to 400mg.

We are all different though.

Take care - ScottieÃ¥Ã_ :)",2,5,3137631,6247,"That's a good idea Scottie.
My pill is 200mg and I've been breaking it in half to get 100mg.
It's difficult to cut it into smaller pieces than that, but perhaps I'll try
taking 100mg every other day for now.
BTW, my terrible pain has really subsided since I stopped the Plaquenil.
Gotta get brave to start taking it again even every other day!",1,4,160637633,6247,"Hi Sharon, My experiences with Plaquenil (generic) are like yours. I'm also very sensitive to drugs (MCS). I did my second challenge with it this past summer. I really tried to stay on it. I was on it for 16 weeks, writing every new symptom down. Within the first 10 days, my peripheral neuropathy became worse, usual numbness and tingling in my feet and hands went to burning and stinging up to mid thighs and mid upper arms. Then it seems all my bones started to ache...that was defiitely new. And I got Burning Mouth Syndrome (self diagnosed), which is when your tongue feels like you burned it on hot food and I could only taste salty and sweet and feel textures but could not tell what I was eating! And all my teeth were hypersensitive to cold or hot. Of course I had stomach issues from the get go which is why I could'nt stay on the Plaquenil the first time. The stomach issues were similar to when I get exposed to sulfa (stomach pain and diarrhea and rash on stomach). And even though rheumie says the sulfate is not the same, I think that my body sensed that the sulfa was there. I react the same when I drink a couple of sips of red wine, I get nauseated and turn bright red and go into a head sweat. I mean, I even react to Neosporin by getting red and rashy! 

So rheumie has me in a holding pattern with Leflunomide and Prednisone. I could never tell if the Leflunomide was working until my liver count went up and I had to come off it for a couple of months. I went into a bad flare and had to up the Prednisone. That's when I realized the Leflunomide was keeping my immune system in check and that the Prednisone really plays a huge part in controlling some of my pain aka 'anti-inflammatory'. I was disappointed about not being about to take the Plaquenil and even suggested trying the brand name as the generic was not working. Insurance would not pay for it and my portion would have been $675 month...yikes! So next rheumie visit, I'm going to ask about other DMARDS...possibly Imuran. I'm sorry I'm rambling but to answer your question, I did feel better after stopping Plaquenil and all the side effects have for the most part subsided except for the bone pain in my long bones. Usually my pain is more muscular in nature and the only thing I notice with joints is stiffness and tenderness. Read the side effects that are listed on drugs.com by patients experiencing Plaquenil. To me the patients experience is more honest than what the studies show at clinical trials. Hope this helps,Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_hugs~hummerbird",2,5,738337634,6247,"For me, if anything disrupts my sleep, I get joint pain and fatigue.Ã¥Ã_ Maybe it isn't the plaquenil per se but it's disrupting your sleep and that's why you feel bad with aches and pains?? Just thought I'd throw that out there. I am also very sensitive and have a hard time pinning down which med is affecting me. Plaquenil can give people vivid dreams and nighmares. I have a sleep disorder as well, so I have to take klonipin to get good sleep. that helped me a lot. I also think I have some fibromyalgia mixed in with my AI dz. as well. 

I hope you get some relief. I know you want the plaquenil to work for you!",4,5,85637635,6247,"Thanks girls, unfortunately I believe I'm experiencing what hummerbird has described:
Peripheral Neuropathy brought on by Plaquenil!

I just can't believe this, I was only on it for about 1 WEEK at 100mg!!!
Now that I've stopped it the neuropathy pains WON'T GO AWAY!
It's been about a week since I stopped it.
I really hope the pains eventually do go away....

Congratulations on your improved health and being stable enough to only need annual rheumy visits! Great way to start the new year!",4,4,48137693,6261,"Hi Winnie, I only see my Rheumatologist once per year. I figure that with all of my other specialists (endocrinologist, ophthalmologist, ENT primary care) that is sufficient. However, it is very important to visit the ophthalmologist for field vision tests when on Plaquenil twice per year. I also visit my dentist at least twice per year, as our oral health with dry mouth can be quite compromised.

Just because I only see my rheumy once per year doesn't mean that I consider myself the picture of health. I can get quite ill when I have a flare.Ã¥Ã_ Between working full time plus my other docs visits, I just don't have either the time or the financial resources for additional office visit copays. I find the once a year visit to my rheumy to be sufficient for me. Take Care.",1,3,425937715,6267,"I know the answer is yes but how many years did it take to get bad?

My eyes are the worst they been since is started. Light sensitivity is really bad. Can it get worst where you cant enjoy a movie or a book?",1,3,346937716,6267,"Cindy,

When I first got sick my dryness was horrible.Ã¥Ã_ I couldn't swallow food, huge mouth ulcers.Ã¥Ã_ Just plain miserable and my eyes were just as bad.Ã¥Ã_ Today, with treatment I am much better.Ã¥Ã_ Things can improve!Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I use Restasis and Evoxac.Ã¥Ã_ Also have punctual plugs.

Anna",1,5,1739128,6495,"eija, it was as others mentioned - a corneal ulcer/infection due to severe dry eyes.Ã¥Ã_ Never heard of such a problem but it is true that it can cause loss of vision. I am being treated with steroid eye drops and some other eye drops at this time. Hoping for the best.",2,4,848937719,6267,"I have had trouble swallowing for decades. Food and pills got stuck in my throat due to dryness. I always slept with water at my bedside and carried water with me at all times.

My eyes started bothering me in about 2009 or 20010. They felt irritated and eventually felt like there was sand in them all of the time. OTC drops did nothing. I had to keep pouring them in every minute or two. In 2011 I was placed on Restasis twice a day. AM and Bedtime. Now, as long as I take the drops like clockwork, my eyes don't bother me except if i am in the wind or on a plane. I occasionally use Systane drops in between the Restasis. 

I was diagnosed with Sjogren's in August 2013 and started on Plaquenil in September. I added Omega 3 supplements 3000 mg (Omega3 EPA and DHA, with higher dose of EPA to DHA) in 2013. I also added some other supplements. I use Mighteaflow mouth products (logenges, rinse, lip balm, mouth spray) and they work well. 

My skin used to be dry as a bone, flaking all of the time even after applying lotion. It was embarrassing. 

Currently all of the areas of dryness, eyes, mouth, throat, skin are much improved. I don't drink water at night any more and can actually go for long periods of time without drinking. I still have trouble swallowing pills and food. My eyes are greatly improved and as long as I take the Restasis I am mostly fine. My skin is dry but not flaking. 

So, overall, my dryness has improved with treatment. 

So, I think there is hope. We are all different, but I think the dryness can improve for many/most of us with treatment.

Are you on any treatment? If not, your opthamologist can order Restasis drops. Restasis actually increases tear production and it is an immunesuppressant so it decreases the immune activity in the eyes.Ã¥Ã_ 

Your Rheumatologist can order Plaquenil. Also, he/she can order some of the drugs for saliva productionÃ¥Ã_ (Salagen or Evoxac).Ã¥Ã_ 

Omega 3 fish oil does help with dryness. It has to be Omega 3 with the correct balance of EPA and DHA, not just fish oil, and needs to be large doses, 2400-3000 mg per day of Omega 3 EPA/DHA with a larger dose of EPA to DHA. 

I hope you can find something that works.

PS: Edited to correct posting error concerning Omega 3 fish oil (EPA and DHA).

I take Life Extensions Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA with Sesame Lignans. My daily dosage is 1400 mg EPA and 1000 mg of DHA from these capsules. I also take New Chapter's whole Omega, which contains another 520 mg of Omega 3. Plus it contains smaller doses of all of the Omega fatty acids (5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and others).",1,5,150537721,6267,"Hello everyone,

I just joined the forum. I've had SjÃŒÃ„Ã¥Â_gren's since I was 8 but diagnosed in my early 20's. I also agree with Jasper, Omega 3s helps with dryness. However, I use straight Omega 3s without Omega 6 because our diets already contains lots of Omega 6 (vegetable oils, nuts, margarine). Have you tried NutraSea Omega 3? Is fantastic! It's liquid and comes in a triglyceride form which is the most bioavailable. 

Hope this helps!

Cristina",1,5,145737723,6267,Cristina24 ..... you are absolutely correct. My brain fog was in high gear when I posted. I did not mean Omega 6. I meant Omega 3 with the correct balance of EPA to DHA.

However, I do keep the visor down in the car and I do wear sun glasses when I am outside.

Some of the people in my Sjogren's support group wear hats with brims or caps with visors (like a base ball cap) most of the time, even inside. When we have our monthly group meetings at the meeting room at Caribou Coffee, we dim the lights because they are too bright for some.

I don't know if this would work, but could you wear tinted glasses when you read or watch movies? Maybe it would help. 

Perhaps your opthamologist, if he/she is familiar with Sjogren's, will have some suggestions. If your opthamalogist is not familiar with Sjogrens, it may be beneficial to get an appointment with an opthamologist who is familiar with Sjogrens.",1,5,150537729,6267,"Hi Cindy,

My flares start with a headache in the back of my head, followed by the BIG THREE:Ã¥Ã_ Fatigue, Pain, Depression.Ã¥Ã_ And for me burning, itching skin.

Flares happen with our Immune Disorder kicks into overdrive.Ã¥Ã_ The result is the inflammation which causes all the terrible stuff, and overdrive is when (IMHO) the damage is being done to our organs and systems.

Can we control or predict flares?Ã¥Ã_ I'm not very good at it, tho' they seem to follow periods of extra stress.Ã¥Ã_ But not always, of course.

And how could we prevent 'periods of extra stress'?Ã¥Ã_ I mean some of the stress is fun stuff, like parties and trips.Ã¥Ã_ And other stress is moving, death in the family, interpersonal 'stuff' which goes on all the time.Ã¥Ã_ 

So we cope.Ã¥Ã_ As best we can.Ã¥Ã_ And share.Ã¥Ã_ Shared stress is stress reduced.

Hugs,Ã¥Ã_ Elaine",3,4,1537846,6284,"This is a sensitive topic, but one I need to know about.Ã¥Ã_ Do any of you ever get (not sure what to call it) sores or pimples in the area of your vagina or the crack of your butt?Ã¥Ã_ It is not herpes.Ã¥Ã_ But sometimes I get what seems to be cuts or lumps that itch badly and then open up, bleed, and go away.Ã¥Ã_ I have read somewhere that it might be the dryness of the vagina opening, but it also happens sometimes in the corners of where my thigh and parts meet.Ã¥Ã_ I think the butt crack one is an unusual place for a hemorrhoid.Ã¥Ã_ Could it be caused by vaginitis infection?Ã¥Ã_ read something on that, too.Ã¥Ã_ See my rheumy on Friday, but I think she is going to send me to the GYN department.Ã¥Ã_ Is this a possible flare?",1,5,142037850,6284,"I have the part on my outer vaginal part. They are like you describe. They arise, but not a pimple, and itch terribly which causes scratching and I have broken through the delicate skin until they have bled. I use a lot of itch cream, but it's an everyday thing. I think it's autoimmune, but I also need to see a gyno.

I found some of the info interesting, and it had some symptoms like ours, and it is autoimmune. 

Let me know what you think.

susanep :)",1,4,32337869,6284,I have chronic yeast infections these past few month. My rheumatologist blames it on the meds. My guess then is to blame the 5 mg a day steroids I have been on since about a year. All the other meds I have been on without any problems. I do have a yearly visit with gyno tomorrow and will ask him about it.,1,5,163537871,6284,"I brought it up to my rheumy today.Ã¥Ã_ She says I should see my nurse practitioner about it.Ã¥Ã_ My nurse practitioner is fabulous so I don't mind waiting to talk to her about it.Ã¥Ã_ Looking forward to seeing what your doc has to say, Susanep.",1,1,142037872,6284,"My gyno today put me on 150 mg diclofonac 1 every other day, then once a week for 6 month.

I sure am tired of dealing with it.",1,4,163537873,6284,"I am glad you are on something now to help with this.

susanep :)",4,1,32337874,6284,"Just discussed this with my dermo, who is a wealth of information. I had been prescribed hormones by my gyno to take twice a week (Vagifem) for the dryness but I started spotting (I'm 61) so I quit. I see my dermo more than gyno and he said to use Monistat once a week to keep the tissues healthy and free from the itchy pimple like bumps I get. So far so good. I tend to get them in the folds of my vulva and actually had one develop into a cyst. That was not a pleasant experience!!! hugs~hummerbird",1,5,738337875,6284,"Judie, I hadÃ¥Ã_ bad problems down there as well. It might have been lichen sclerosis, I had cracks in my skin between the vagina and anal area. I also had bad atrophy from menopause and being off hormones. I had to go back on systemic estrogen two years ago and it's gotten much better. I also had chronic UTI's. Sometimes, everything would just burn down there and I wasn't sure where the burn was coming from....Ã¥Ã_ Ã¥Ã_I had been using the vaginal estrogen but I was so dry, it just burned me something awful. It took some systemic estrogen to turn it around. I use a patch. Good luck to you. This is not fun and can be very painful.",1,5,85637876,6284,"I probably need some of the estrogen, but because many years ago now IÃ¥Ã_ had a blood clot in the calf of my leg, none of them will give me any hormones. I don't know what to do. 

susanep :)",1,4,32337902,6294,"Not been here for ages but I was looking up microscopic haematuria and saw an earlier thread here. I thought I'd start a new one on this subject. 

To update - I have a new rheumatologist now, having moved to a new area of Scotland. He has been ruminating for three months now and I haven't the faintest idea what he is going to come up with when he finally sends me his letter. He took all my autoantibodies and I had a full work up from the specialist nurses including BP (high as always), urine dipstick, full blood count and CRP plus X-rays of chest, feet and hands. Also he asked for the Schirmers test and saliva test to be done. As far as I know the tear one was okay but my eyes became very dry again a few weeks later. 

So then I went to the optician who did a tear break up blink test and he told me my eyes were very dry again so I'm back on ointment and drops when I remember. He also found a flame haemorrhage in one eye which we decided probably related to my hypertension - which my last doctor failed to acknowledge or treat. I'm anti borderline for Athlerosclerosis. My BP us now being treated by an ARB inhibitor drug. 

This year I've had a lumbar puncture that went wrong, pneumonia, two lots of sepsis, pancreatitis from Imuran - gallbladder removed and post op wound abscess plus two stroke like events, described by my neurologist as functional neurological episodes.Ã¥Ã_ But since moving things have improved enormously. The small fibre neuropathy has continued much the same in arms and legs but I'm sort of used to it now although some nights I have to take heavy duty pain relief or shower in cool water. 18 months of awful dizziness has gone and none of my RA synptoms have returned. I'm incredibly busy and pretty happy for the most part. 

The only things that get me down are my mouth and this achy pressure in my bladder and round my back. I've had traces of blood found in my urine three times now so GP has referred me to a urologist because there's no sign of UTI or kidney infection. Does anyone else have microscopic haematuria with no infection and yet with quite annoying symptoms in bladder or kidneys. I do have a large irregular cyst on my kidney which my GP said may possibly be bleeding a bit. Could this be a Sjogrens thing perhaps or just m another coincidence?",1,5,206037903,6294,"I had microscopic hematuria (blood in urine) for several years in my 50's.
Ã¥Ã_
Years later (about 12) I suddenly had chronic UTI's and then IC.

I don't know if they are connected.

When I had the microscopic hematuria I had an IVP scan of my kidneys to check them.Ã¥Ã_ they were OK.

You want your kidneys checked out probably.

Otherwise don't worry.

Hugs.Ã¥Ã_ Elaine",2,5,1537904,6294,"Thanks but I'm not worried Elaine - just curious to know if this microscopic haematuria is part of a bigger connective tissue/ Sjogrens pattern for many people or just another idiopathic thing. I had it all the way through my last pregnancy too - 19 years ago now. I know it can just be something and nothing for most people and they have to rule out cancer before saying it's benign. I do have a large, irregular cyst on one of my kidneys and my GP said it might be this bleeding slightly now. Mat x",1,5,206037905,6294,"In my case, I think it was the first sign of my Interstitial Cystitis, which is the result (In my opinion) of the entire BIG PICTURE of my Immune System attacking my body: Severe Eczema, Sjogren's type issues, Peripheral Neuropathy, Anemia, Meniere's, Small Fiber Neuropathy, and so on.

The underlying cause of most of my problems, including inflammation of the lining of my arteries leading to Severe Coronary Artery Disease, is attacks by my Immune System on my system.Ã¥Ã_ The inflammation does the damage where ever the attack occurs.
Ã¥Ã_
Hang in there........It is what it is, and gaining as much relief as possible is the answer.Ã¥Ã_ I finally found that my Immune System is severely disordered when I was diagnosed at 71 with and Immune Deficiency.Ã¥Ã_ My deficient Immune System doesn't protect me (that's why I have to add IgG to my body every month) but it DOES attack me.

If you don't laugh, you will cry.Ã¥Ã_ So LAUGH as much as you can!

Hugs,Ã¥Ã_ Elaine",2,5,1537906,6294,"I have had constant microscopic blood in my urine for about 30 yrs now. About 8 yrs ago I was diagnosed with Loin Pain Haematuria Syndrome which has recently been linked in studies with Lupus. So I guess as Sjogren's and Lupus are fairly close, it could be associated. I don't bother with this dx and just deal with the occasional kidney aches and the passing of blood clots as they happen. This is pretty much a benign condition which doesn't lead to kidney damage. I'm sure your urologist will be aware to keep this as a possibility. I hope you find the right answers for you
Sarah",4,5,834837907,6294,Thanks Sarah. It's strange to think of something involving the passing of blood clots as benign isn't it?! Once anything sinister has been ruled out then it's really just my curiosity and slight concern that my kidneys may be at risk if I have lupus nephritis or something. Bearing in mind I'm now nor on any disease modifying antirheumatic medication at all.,2,4,206037908,6294,"Oops, my experience was with protein, not blood, in urine.

Nothing to see here. Carry on.

Ã¥Ã_:)",1,2,48137909,6294,"Thanks for telling me your experience. I did have blood in urine for the entire 9 months of one of my pregnancies - but I don't know if it went after the birth because I wasn't tested. Then, while in hospital four times this year I had blood and protein in my pee - diagnosed with UTI with sepsis but I believe it was actually pacreatitis as a response to Azathioprine/ Imuran. The current three successive findings have come at a time when I'm relatively un-stressed although I'm incredibly busy and life is full of excitement and joy so this can't be stress related in my case. Symptoms for me seem to come in cycles. I will have RA for a few years, dizziness for a few years, rhinitis, alopecia, sicca, infections including pneumonia - all will come of torrents and knock me right off my feet, terrible ill - and then I'll be standing once more wondering if this really happened? The constants for a few years now have been parasthesia/ pins and needles everywhere, dru eyes and a pain just below my ribs all the way around my chest. Also my mouth is sore with parasthesia too and my nose bleeds and has numbness and a feeling of pressure that no dentist can explain. 

I guess if this is as bad as things get I'm a pretty lucky woman!",1,5,206037910,6294,"Mat51, after reading your post, I had to revise my prior one.

I hope you find your situation is nothing serious.",4,1,48137912,6294,"On a slightly different note, I had some bleeding this weekend. I had total hysterectomy ,10 years ago so not menstrual blood. Then I used a tampon to see if there was blood in vag - nothing, so I can only conclude it's from bladder. Saw GP last night and am being treated for another bladder infection - I do feel fluish but not typical bladder infection symptoms.

I've arranged to see a gyny doctor early January, after our ruby wedding cruise 
Kathyx",1,5,1437915,6294,"I don't know a lot about Haematuria in urine but you are not the only person with SS who has this. Of course seeing your GP, urologist and rheum. is very important to properly diagnose the source of the blood. But perhaps we can all put our heads together on this issue and solve it. Since I went through menopause, 2011, I have very low estrogen and I'm very dry in the female area. Sometimes when I urinate I can feel the dryness and sensitivity of the area because the urine can make it burn, so I know the dryness is causing an abrasion. Could a dry abrasion be the source of the blood? Is the bladder opening dry? Let's try to figure this out together. Thank you. All the best to everyone.

Also, I read a very sensitive article about bladder infections in children that explains indepth the issue of bladder infections in general. Thought it might help someone. http://www.askdrsears.com/topics/health-concerns/childhood-illnesses/bladder-infections",4,5,7882
